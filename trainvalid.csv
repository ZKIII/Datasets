im not sure i havent seen every episode but i still enjoyed it its hard to say which episode was my favorite,positive
this film has everything ask yourself are you a fan of and ive seen a lot of movies,positive
its not going to be the japanese version the show is great but,positive
i would love to see either of them in another movie,positive
this movie is great if you enjoy watching b class movies that is,positive
if you can do that it really is good s s s s i doubt it too bad,positive
this movie has some things that are pretty amazing first it is supposed to be based on a true story the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it,positive
first of all i want to point on screen play,positive
this is the best movie i have ever seen any movie that can get children to learn history is great,positive
lets start with the good things this is not a movie for kids the action scenes are great here too ok over to the things i didnt like thats that,positive
but it is still dont care is it worth try it,positive
while by no means a classic the directors involved do have an idea what suspense is,positive
good film thing is the film is named to kill for such a shame,positive
want action want more go out and buy this video,positive
i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out and to this day still do i am surprised not too many people know about it cool flick,positive
however the ending was really cool i say its must see i liked him lots i loved her rest of the cast do fine overall a must see,positive
i love this film it is well written and acted and has good cinematography see it buy it show it to your friends it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end,positive
i dont understand it really this is a good movie the supporting cast is good as well and the music in the movie is great its probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is,positive
ever since i was a child this has been one of my favorite stories i want nothing from you why cant we be friends it is a moving performance and one of the movies most dramatic scenes not,positive
things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence,positive
this is an average short but its still worth watching,positive
not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one its worth the effort,positive
i am not a very good writer so ill keep this short,positive
the film is unique in many ways this film will be two hours of your time well spent,positive
but they just dont understand the movie and the reason is because they understand the movie,positive
i must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time and i was not disappointed youll love it,positive
much to my surprise it wasnt about that at all,positive
he has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing,positive
one of my most favorite films this is a real moment in time,positive
he was both funny and sad the script worked well too,positive
you want a friend get a dog at first all good no bad right everything goes to hell of course love that guy on some level i like that take the kids,positive
but the plot i heard was so great was so predictable plus the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie wrong in short not much happens,positive
often feels like you are part of an audience at a stage show,positive
the cast is first rate the film is a great deal of fun worth a look,positive
the end of an era its a shame that this movie is however not among their best the premise of the movie sounds good and is good most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable,positive
and while this is yet another one it is different enough and well made that i still enjoyed it and many problems result,positive
it is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but i found this movie pretty entertaining dont get me wrong its certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look i thought the acting which seemed forced at first somehow got better as the film went along it seems like the actors really got into their roles,positive
if anyone every finds this movie i would absolutely love to see it whats not to love,positive
its a well acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away its a good film,positive
well this is new the name mr youre a god mr,positive
after all arent movies meant to be a good time the movie itself was an all around good time just dont expect to have to think too much about it because then if you take it too seriously then the movie actually wont be fun but stupid instead,positive
i enjoyed this movie quite a lot this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama,positive
the supporting cast are too good coming back everything was almost great except for the drama part,positive
i just love the movie the movie was excellent and its a very good actor so it deserves that and more there are some actors that do not act very well but have a oscar anyway it does not matter but he is perfect brilliant and beautiful,positive
i read the book before i saw the movie i knew the movie was going to be good because the book was great i seriously recommend you see this amazing fantastic movie i know you will like it,positive
i will be watching this movie many many more times find a friend who does and watch it there but for those times just boys got it today i hope some of it goes to girls,positive
that is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action she begins to fight against god mr who knows does she still have hope in her life the final scene gives us hope thats her hope,positive
the actors are great especially the little ones one knows when a movie is good when one just does not want it to end but eventually everything does,positive
overall the point of the movie is just to have fun and im sure that you will,positive
while of course none of this is new it was enjoyable and well made,positive
i kept expecting it to fall apart but it never really did,positive
not as bad a film as i thought it would be it has a good cast,positive
he will have an oscar one day it was realistic too it is all realistic,positive
the movie was good which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie,positive
but for me it will always be a little known masterpiece a,positive
you know how its going to end but it has a great time getting there,positive
but this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time,positive
if you ever get the chance to see this live then go the music live music,positive
i think its a great movie is the end but you dont get to see how it is at home and i didnt really like it that you also dont get to see how her father is doing and her brother i had a great time watching it,positive
and what can you say for the rest of the cast,positive
the editing and effects are well done better than many films in the genre,positive
because those perfect the one and only best ever reviews make some people turn away including me unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it,positive
this was a very funny movie based on the classic series,positive
great acting and it is a film that gives something to think about it is probably one of her greatest films ever go and see,positive
what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie,positive
i am head is a movie that could only come from those inside the box remember the old joke everything you know is wrong perhaps perhaps not very funny will please the fans no plot,positive
this film was funny as hell if not you may not get it at all,positive
i really dont understand how anyone couldnt laugh a lot during this hilarious film,positive
we have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job,positive
as a matter of fact this is the best movie ive ever seen its an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best that movie is the best and it will always stay that way,positive
i dont know why its horrible what they did to the film,positive
but that scene will stay with you go for it,positive
loved it wonderful acting it is totally horror but it was funny when it was meant to be,positive
im your mother and i love you what does really say ive heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means she did what he wanted her to do,positive
he gets a chance to show off a bit i thought it was a good movie hes just hilarious you could do much much worse,positive
i have bad it is excellent the song and the video are very very good indeed same for leave me alone which appears after anyway nice to see you,positive
its a masterpiece of cinematography and music yes and also of editing direction writing and acting,positive
its not even close we need something different s s s version does have a better soundtrack than the original version s version,positive
which is why id have loved to see follow up movies no seriously,positive
this was a hilarious movie and i would see it again and again,positive
this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children,positive
to top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent,positive
first many of the action sequences really arent that much fun not cool silly or even funny silly but just silly thats not to say there arent some great action scenes but most simply dont come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen,positive
the story was made for these actors the characters make the movie so realistic this movie very simply gets an a plus from me watch this film,positive
and shes one year older than me the beginning seemed slow though,positive
the only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting,positive
everyone my name may sound weird but there was nothing else any way i havent seen anything like this before so it was crazy of course thats a good thing also how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema in this movie they are not but apart from that it s great,positive
but overall it was realistic and didnt lack the action but only did it on mr,positive
and thats just what they try to do it works well,positive
the atmosphere the setting the actors the camera work everything is just beautiful and they really work well with each other go see it now,positive
these are the ones i remember best as a four year old you had to have been there,positive
but while its a great video its not perfect even though it seemed like it at the time,positive
without a doubt the best late night television ever question,positive
whatever it was this movie was worth the time they are both worth watching,positive
absolutely the best thing i have ever seen on tv,positive
i didnt expect to like this film as much as i did it didnt look particularly great i like to think of it as much more than that give it a try,positive
it shows that mr the lead performances are very good indeed,positive
this is probably the greatest war film and certainly one of the greatest films,positive
whats not to like i like long stories watch the movie and that will make sense so we did,positive
after i saw the movie i must say it was even better than i thought,positive
i think that everyone should see it if they can find it its a must see classic,positive
if you have read the novel i recommend that you also view this movie,positive
one can only hope for a dvd box set strong a,positive
its a nice family movie she finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girls family in many ways she is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run,positive
i miss it king its clearly a game to him hes probably the most fun to watch of the three although they all have their moments and often too,positive
i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end,positive
in fact amazing how much better something like that is,positive
that should tell you something i think that despite the lack of dialogue the actors did a fantastic job on the episode,positive
this was a really nice surprise because this film was very good this film made me realize hes a good actor too bad he was a quality actor and seemed like a nice guy now i understand why this movie was so good the script was one reason this film is so good it just shows you that a lot can be said with few words,positive
from this point on his look at life will never be the same,positive
but the film is much more than that its put together really well and doesnt take itself too seriously thats the beauty of it i would definitely recommend this movie if not for any other reason than the fact it is something different to experience,positive
this is a great movie this is one of the best action films ive ever seen and ive seen a lot this has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines,positive
a it doesnt have an amazing story but there is one there i really loved this character the music was superb as well you cant go wrong here,positive
hes so fine i was so sad at the end his girl was wrong why it kept my eyes on the screen my sister loved it also so i am going to see it again because now my friends want to see it and its worth seeing two times,positive
its all really well done is it perfect if you get the chance see this,positive
boy was he wrong the supporting cast is great as well this film has it all,positive
this movie is not your typical horror movie very believable,positive
none the less it happened the film would be better if he had,positive
i thought that this film was very enjoyable i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child,positive
it is in many ways a feel good horror film,positive
ok so it can be done a wonderful story believable i recommend that one to,positive
you know how its going to end but it has a great time getting there,positive
then you will certainly enjoy this film this movie was pretty much everything i expected,positive
i just loved it all of it one again the writers have done it that pretty good imdb,positive
well for those who are interested watch this film very good film indeed,positive
i highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies but remember i never said it was good just fun,positive
this movie is a lot of fun my parents even did good special effects may be scary for the little ones deserves an a,positive
she watched it for a second time with me her as if for the first time again,positive
for what it is this is a pretty good movie they both give strong performances,positive
okay that was just brilliant it really needed more episodes like this writing was fantastic and so was the editing the first five star episode for me really good almost like a movie i didnt even remember it being this good i think its even better than the great horror movie called the thing,positive
i loved this movie it is a very simple plot and from what i understand it is based on a true story,positive
anyone can tell me what happened to her what happened to her did she kill herself,positive
well i am still lost in this question guess what reality is just too scary im on break,positive
shes that good why isnt this woman a major star,positive
what can i add that the previous comments havent already said,positive
now i really must read the original book as soon as possible,positive
the music used in the film is also particularly powerful,positive
but that is where even more problems begin dont miss this,positive
im here to tell you now its been worth the wait may there be many more,positive
i watched it over and over again until i new every word,positive
this is possibly one of my favorite films i think that it is a great film for all the family to enjoy,positive
how can you not laugh at least once at this movie,positive
thats how this movie is with me one more thing be sure to watch the end credits and friends,positive
i however think something else is the case and whats even more boring,positive
the problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time,positive
i enjoyed it there you go i said it again,positive
i really liked the film go watch the movie you will enjoy it overall this movie was perfect its sequel is good but not good as this movie i think there should be a third sequel to it my whole family enjoyed this film chance was full of humor again i say this movie is a must watch this movie is a classic,positive
i wont even try to tell you the plot in a sense completely ridiculous,positive
why the actors did a good job it feels like a real documentary film even if its not it does not get boring for a moment i recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror,positive
and also i did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much action,positive
that makes me laugh every time i see it it was definitely money well spent,positive
oh forget it whats to say its actually pretty funny thats really all it is its entertaining youll just be disappointed,positive
it is such a shame that i could buy this film only from the french and not from the english so i have to learn in french to enjoy watching it,positive
his comic turn in once more with feeling was quite nice s s did they have to,positive
thats why i am giving it a ten out of ten,positive
there is not one romance there are at least three but they all have to do with the same family,positive
and best of all its actually a good movie a s all the actors are good,positive
the more things change the more they stay the same as the saying goes,positive
if you watch it with that in mind it turns into a really good film,positive
dr they both need to get away theyre all alone together you can pretty much figure out the rest every single bit of the plot is predictable still the movie does work,positive
the acting is superb with so many things going for it why isnt this a great film,positive
one of the best love stories i have ever seen,positive
this well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say,positive
the very first scene i watched him was really strong,positive
you wont feel well with this one you wont feel happy,positive
it was just what i needed i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others just great i didnt want it to end the end,positive
the plot is simple but they do it real good in this movie now this is the best story in the whole movie very good plot twist,positive
all of the characters i wanted to live were getting killed,positive
i rather liked this mystery and is worth having if you like this sort of thing,positive
mr for those who havent watched the film perhaps you should stop reading here mr mr,positive
i have not had the chance to see him live but that is something that i really want to do now,positive
where do they come from how did they get there where will they end up,positive
theyre simply wonderful shes not just a pretty face shes a monster of an actress as well,positive
its been years since i have seen these shows i thought i made them up just give them a shot,positive
this story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to view theres enough for both,positive
i love you a few minutes later this fan is hit by a car and killed these scenes are funny and interesting someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies,positive
shame on you if you give this film a low rating it may be crap but is definitely good crap,positive
all in all its a good film for fans of the genre,positive
this is a wonderful film and i hope more people get to see it go go,positive
due to the lack of love for this show by many i cant see it going to a season series but you never know,positive
though the music the voice and the performance may be are very much so,positive
whether its a good movie or not films of this kind has to be made i think,positive
you will not find any deep message in this movie but its worth watching,positive
go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out,positive
this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it,positive
so i decided to check it out and i was surprised is it low budget yes can you tell that its low budget yes i dont know whats up with all these bad reviews for this film all i hear is worst movie ever why im out,positive
to make it worse this movie is very badly cast,positive
its to bad that most people will avoid this film that didnt work before please give this movie a chance s,positive
what they want with her no matter what they did to the film they made it worse they should have left well enough alone dont they,positive
cant wait to see what he does with the sequel,positive
the wonderful characters stories directors writers i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them i never want the show to die,positive
they are right as this is exactly what happened with me,positive
those with supporting roles are also quite good you will remember this movie for many years see it,positive
it turns out everyone in the story has some right and some wrong,positive
i knew nothing about the movie before watching it i know i will,positive
i cant believe people are giving bad reviews about this movie i wonder why maybe because of the book i have to admit it really doesnt follow the book for sure but the movie is also good as well it has the suspense the acting are good give this movie a chance there are still lot more worse movie than this this are some of the worse movie i have seen im looking for this movie but it is really hard to be found on dvd watch it,positive
both the book and the film are excellent in their own right the rest of the cast are very good,positive
id love to own a copy how do i go about getting one,positive
it is definitely very much a masterpiece in its own way,positive
why not for classic final scenes this movie is a stand out,positive
in fact it would probably be my second favorite in the series good,positive
i wasnt really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away the result of lack of all of these features was however a wonderful film and i will be watching it again soon i will be also interested to find out what my family and friends think of it,positive
a movie ive seen and enjoyed possibly more than any other movie humor drama action love,positive
perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff and much worse etc,positive
try to get a copy of it and see for yourself a,positive
a good film and one ill watch a number of times were there more in the original,positive
the only reason i can think of why the score is so low is that for the most part the man,positive
my god this was a fantastic film everyone it is a must see,positive
the sci fi story might be found average for many to me was really good dont miss it,positive
the plot in police story is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place,positive
in the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy,positive
give it a chance i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr,positive
this is true to the time it was set and the time it was made,positive
this movie is definitely worth a look it has all the things you need for a horror movie i still love it as much as i did all those years ago buy this movie,positive
this is a funny movie theres not a lot of those,positive
i give mr despite this it is so original and so hilarious that you wont care about that,positive
what is the deal with this stupid comment thing i should be able to write one as long or in this case as short as i want,positive
i guess i do though ever since i saw that movie i was looking forward to his next work i think he did a pretty good job with this film and i again look forward to his next work i hope you enjoy the film,positive
id like to do that and i know you would too great stuff,positive
and what after life the way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any hollywood movie could ever make,positive
so please take time out to watch this classic western,positive
there are some great shots as for this film it will please most i think,positive
the direction of this movie is very very good see this movie,positive
this movie came as a total surprise to me i still am not a big fan of him but i sure am a fan now his performance is one of the best performances i have seen in a long long time all in all a superb film,positive
thats just a bit of the story behind it even if you are not buy,positive
its not a good movie how often do you see that no,positive
it is a classic the stories and actors are excellent the music and song just fantastic,positive
there are a few parts that didnt sit well with me anyway great film,positive
i question anyone saying they dont care for this movie the acting performances are superb come on,positive
after youve seen and liked those check out this one,positive
some of the camera shots in the film were done very well,positive
i loved this movie every story was better than the last id recommend this film to every horror fan,positive
which isnt to say that its a bad movie and who,positive
and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines,positive
hes a hit man now and george doesnt really know what he does for a living i think you can figure the rest out,positive
i think its not only a very good but a very important movie,positive
well see this one and maybe it will make more sense,positive
is as much as you can ask well okay not really,positive
the acting is superb and there are some very moving moments along the way as well i recommend this movie very much see it,positive
but the wait was somewhat worth it i cant say the movie was great and i cant say that the movie was hilarious but it was good and it has some pretty funny points,positive
no doubt about it a the plot theres an actual plot line here,positive
they show each other different ways of looking at things,positive
so much so i cant see any acting going on here at all it really makes you think,positive
but is the film worth watching or worth trying to figure out,positive
mr a great flick if you havent already seen it watch it,positive
so what after watching this movie it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor one final note,positive
i am not sure why lets face it this is the world we live in,positive
cut i wont go on with this a first rate job all around,positive
to die for has it all this film has a great cast,positive
to view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely,positive
so well done for at least trying to make a true version,positive
okay this movie maybe not his features now it has every thing are beautiful overall,positive
like all shows though it is not perfect it is nothing like those shows still that first time around is very very funny give it a shot,positive
i found it to be very enjoyable i would definitely recommend this movie,positive
okay little did i know this was a soundtrack of a movie its a nice little film its worth a look,positive
too bad only a few people saw this film this film really deserves better,positive
man i loved this movie this really takes me back to when i was a kid i still remember one of the opening lines he gets to live the way he always wanted to,positive
youll have to see the movie if you want to know why,positive
i took it very very hard now about this movie,positive
im in love with that woman i got what i expected but only half i think the supporting cast do what they can its a good example of feel good cinema,positive
isnt it what we both wanted says one of the couple what did he want to say here,positive
dont know what else is he lets leave it at that,positive
its a love story with a twist the characters are unique and believable if film is an art this is close to a masterpiece,positive
never the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all,positive
ok wasnt quite expecting that but lets see what the movie has to say im looking for other movies this person may have done with more experience,positive
it was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and i think this movie wouldnt be that nice if she was not in the leading role,positive
this movie almost has everything not a lot of films have bad bad guys,positive
and it was really good im looking forward to seeing her in more films,positive
actually i think this is one of the best tv shows and i totally recommend this to all men who like women,positive
i dont really know whether its true or not but isnt that what life is like why i dont think so for this movie one is the sound,positive
and maybe thats good this little horror film could have gone way more wrong than it did,positive
loved this movie love the idea love the script love the characters if you are a big fan of scary and silly then this is your movie only taken off one star because i would love to have had better sound not bad sound but would have liked to have more oh loved the making of too,positive
the children are not the only ones looking for this island,positive
but i would have liked to have seen it maybe they didnt want too much going on in one episode,positive
its the best movie ive watched this year horror action suspense sci fi documentary love story and all the human interest story you can get youll find everything here the thing is now let me ask you this after youve seen it,positive
excellent direction and camera supporting cast is good small cast,positive
the last hour of the film is very entertaining i would buy this movie did i write ten lines yet,positive
it is my favorite film of the last two years great acting and comedy,positive
this is a very funny and unique film especially for the zombie genre i very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different,positive
now im going to watch it with this in mind and see what happens,positive
i also liked the style of animation used and the theme of the episode,positive
ive seen the movie over and over again and each time i see something new,positive
this is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy,positive
as a kid i thought this movie was great but what if it isnt,positive
this is not a film for everyone she knows exactly what i am saying,positive
im not that person though its still very funny to me would they make it s so thats about as deep as the plot gets it makes fun of itself and you are not expected to take it seriously,positive
man this movies good if you can find this movie rent it,positive
ive heard that before where i highly recommend the soundtrack if you dont feel like going to the movies,positive
it is so interesting where did this guy come from,positive
he is acting here this is not the case here yet,positive
the plot is quite simple in fact mr check this one out,positive
ive just seen this movie for the second time on television the characters lines are not particularly memorable,positive
i would never want to know anyone well who didnt love this movie,positive
however it turned out to be quite good very well done the two stand out features are the dialog and acting great cast,positive
the animation is superb your heart really goes out to the characters in this film nothing was forced or over done,positive
i would love to see this released on dvd so that more might see it everyone should,positive
ill never forget the first time my brother saw him who he said plus kids love it and the new year party,positive
the direction is great the acting is fantastic rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one,positive
the hit men however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her the story was well directed and the actors did a fine job it had everything i always want to see when watching a comedy,positive
it is very sad to think there are kids out there like this,positive
i love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years it does get better with every viewing no special effects here what you see is real,positive
the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it,positive
absolutely a classic in its own particular kind of way if you get a chance to see this movie do so,positive
the plot is good even if characters arent could have something to do with the acting put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get this is classic low budget sci fi and deserves it just due,positive
but thats typical of how things go for this crew it will be worth it,positive
come on people its a story based on some real people thats all i think she did it pretty well who knows,positive
actually i think ive only watched one or two apart from this one the plot is pretty good,positive
who needs a story with fighting like that really its worth watching for that reason alone,positive
if you take the movie for what it is worth you wont be disappointed the story line is simple and easy to follow one nice thing about this movie it has a message,positive
i liked this movie we all know this crime will not turn out perfect the story is told in a nice way the scenes between them are the better scenes in the movie i think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable you would think,positive
to make a long review short too late you wont be disappointed,positive
it also made many of their best stories into great western drama b i,positive
and it still is i wasnt sure which of the three movies came first then second and last i still think the middle movie was the best,positive
the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant,positive
i cant believe people are looking for a plot in this film,positive
romance and drama this is really a very sad movie very moving i see this as being very realistic and being so real makes the movie that much more moving,positive
but i did enjoy it good team they should work together more it is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie,positive
going into this movie i had heard good things about it there were a couple of laughs here and there nothing too funny,positive
rent this for the whole family everyone will enjoy this,positive
once they have his stuff this movie should have been all about him his life s,positive
this documentary is such a wonderful example of what an entertaining and amazing experience a documentary can be if done so well as this,positive
i had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it,positive
just from the title its obvious that this low budget horror comedy isnt meant to be taken seriously watch and enjoy,positive
but this show is a work of art the one bad thing is the title really,positive
of course that was before the show hit he was a real local yes id love to see this on dvd,positive
the least they should do is release it on dvd,positive
what is that song but i will be looking back here,positive
my favorite movie what a great story this really was id just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible,positive
my parents and i love this movie keep cool different hilarious,positive
this was one of the best shows ever made for tv made us go what why did they do that with one of the best shows ever,positive
and the cast no one out of place or out of character if you havent seen it do,positive
and that is to learn what you enjoy i think i have given my opinion on the matter,positive
in truth there are no good guys or bad guys in this film the film itself isnt exactly original,positive
this was a very good movie and well worth watching,positive
i loved the way this film was shot overall this film is a must see,positive
i really like this show i really like this show,positive
and it certainly is worth seeing along with the rest of the cast and as for what happens at the end well the only thing ill say is that youll never guess the ending but if you get the chance to see it i would recommend you do and if worse comes to worst theres always video,positive
you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film,positive
it is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing,positive
i would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review anyway there are films directors stars what who i want to see despite any reviews the man is a cop but it cant maybe the script is not good,positive
its an amazing film from an amazing director whose taken his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see and everyone who can should,positive
i remember this film from many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in my experience i wish it would be shown on tv at least once or is it,positive
yes i call this a perfect movie i can also recommend it,positive
the music was excellent it would be great if there was a sequel,positive
if you get a chance to give this one a look please do so,positive
i really hope they re release this in dvd form soon,positive
he has taken a small beautiful story and has made a small beautiful movie,positive
that said the rest is pretty bad however it does have one truly memorable scene nothing like it wonderful stuff right up with the best in any western,positive
but why would his family ask this i found it to be better than the short story it was based on the two try to learn a way to save her,positive
sound to good to be true dont take my word for it see it for yourself is that all dont expect to learn anything and dont expect to have to think a whole lot but do expect to have fun with this modern sci fi action classic,positive
oh its an excellent piece of work to be sure do these two give bad performances so whats the problem,positive
this movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel you have to see this movie,positive
well not this time and it works not only does it work it works very very well in fact i think its perfect well they do in this movie,positive
a b he is simply hilarious in this you might just enjoy it,positive
the problem is that one set comes with the other its got something,positive
you can see his humor in all his movies great,positive
the story of course wasnt excellent but it also wasnt boring so if you like to laugh watch this movie,positive
then some believe that they hear it but they dont,positive
one of the best movies out there something different from the usual movies and great fun the sets are not amazing but simple and worked for the overall look of the film take a look and think like a child its a great view and very fun,positive
this show has come so far just close out the series big time guys you are the best,positive
well the acting was actually very good is a single one of them bad it cant be bad not possible s it simply wasnt anything all that special,positive
after watching this i see i knew nothing its hard to believe it wasnt documentary footage it was so real,positive
and things would be simple if the story was what i have just told once it happened you then question what would happen next,positive
hes always funny even when he does or says very little,positive
when i mention it to anyone they can remember very little too was it real or maybe a dream,positive
but perhaps it is the actors who really do that,positive
but this one is and its great and i enjoyed it too the film is excellent,positive
now i have seen it the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great well stupid some cheap drama still,positive
there are two things which really give this movie its power the first is its cast but then its meant to be,positive
this is not a good movie but i still like it anyway i liked it but dont expect too much it really is so bad its good,positive
id never see or heard of him before this film,positive
when was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie but it has a lot more i loved the ending s,positive
thats what one of the girls said at the end,positive
all i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one its a long way from reality to sci fi but what if,positive
the other cast of characters in the story are not there for background either every one in this story has a history to them,positive
much said without words this is an excellent movie most highly recommend try to rent it or find it on line,positive
i need to buy it but i cant find at any place,positive
or so you think for the first half of the movie,positive
im sorry but i think its classic comedy well what if you like whos that girl,positive
i have read the book but i really think the movie is much better he was brilliant,positive
it had the sort of characters and character development for a series some very good character actors in this fine film and quite romantic in its way,positive
and these things dont happen in the open completely possible all that happened later on possible too so you wont find a war story in this film or at least not the kind of war story you expect,positive
when was the last time a horror film was as much fun as this one,positive
but in this movie theres no real scene of action,positive
difficult film to comment on how do you say its bad,positive
there is just one good fight scene until the big ending but not enough fighting for a top rating,positive
i havent seen the original japanese version yet but both films are definitely on my to see list,positive
but i cant leave oh my god in that case stay inside its a good show,positive
i like every actor in this movie one scene that i think is very good is the scene when dr the good doctor is saying no while his evil side is saying yes if his character was taken out you wouldnt miss him dont miss this movie,positive
there is none like it and i dont think there ever will be i absolutely loved it a movie has never made me so happy,positive
a happy wonderful feel good ending you know how its going to end from the beginning but thats really not the point here,positive
it has a same story both guys fall in love with the same woman i dont think that the story line is too strong,positive
the theater although he went a little far but it was still a beautiful story,positive
it is a great movie no matter this good for they for all actors all for the director,positive
how can someone not like this movie best horror movie ever how is that not funny,positive
i cant wait for the full film though i still mean it and i cannot stop here yet this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do i do have a lot of those,positive
how can a name not even a real name break your heart all of them work,positive
i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone please go see it it is a great film,positive
the strong points in the film were clear for the beginning and middle part of the film etc,positive
the best of the best you never know whats next,positive
loved all the characters and actors anyone know if it is out on video yet would love to see it again,positive
ive seen in three times and it got better each time,positive
what more can i say all in all great movie get the dvd if you can,positive
i recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that sort of thing,positive
and most of all you lack the true love of life that children have,positive
so we have to keep watching to find out more about his past watch this show,positive
this is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments,positive
not just a name when you see the flick you will understand what i am saying i would like to see this film on the big screen the footage was shot really well,positive
this show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television this show could possibly be the best show in television history,positive
i feel that they and others like them dont know what true horror is no movie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me no movie i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today but they dont and it is just not the same no one know why he wants to kill her but he does she goes to the car and tries to open it it wont let you down now tell me what horror film would you rather watch,positive
they also play a major role in the shows story well the first season is great this is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other the first season is original funny and enjoyable the second season is good although it isnt as good as the first the third season is my favorite,positive
he was that down and out she probably was there however,positive
and she is right of course come on acting is simply great,positive
and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it,positive
i enjoyed the plot of the movie i thought i would comment on this movie and just say its not that bad,positive
well turns out this movie was a lot more than i would have thought it was a great story first of all s,positive
this film is a masterpiece to put it simply it is now his turn to take over,positive
yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them,positive
s and well watch this movie if you want to know what im talking about does everything make sense,positive
also its obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of film making,positive
one of the best films ive ever seen he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life,positive
where do i start do i say how great the cinematography is we see no scenes of this family in the us the film is a near miss,positive
the ending was bad as well she tries to get way but she doesnt have a chance she wanted it and that look had me thinking i was behind that well,positive
must be special effects this kept from her and the rest of the family,positive
the acting was great i heard it was based on a true story if so then that is hilarious and amazing i highly recommend this movie,positive
this film is so different to anything you would have seen before a very sad but extremely interesting and unique film,positive
well a surprise in fact she is just as good as anyone else in the movie do with that what you will what do you expect to happen see the movie and you will understand what i mean just when you think the camera will turn away it does not who knows,positive
when they do talk he cant show her who he really is for me the film was all right,positive
we love her as much as the camera does and the camera work,positive
this film was really eye opening i have seen this film several times,positive
the actors were perfectly cast our money was well spent on this movie,positive
this is a story about a family really getting to know each other they are just doing them much later in life at times his eyes look so sad,positive
it is now one of my favorite movies of all time,positive
i love this movie i could watch it over and over again this is a story of real true love the only real way to end this movie for real true love what more could you ask for theres not a better ending to this great love story than this what else can i say about this great movie,positive
if you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try,positive
this movie is just great well the fun keeps on coming overall a great movie,positive
nothing too deep or too scary just a nice story line and i would have never known mr he was just a baby really when he made this movie but very much worth watching,positive
this scene is possibly meant to be funny but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film and after all as far as we can see and hope for it is a happy ending,positive
not to mention the entire thing seemed rather ridiculous basically dont take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy yourself,positive
t the laughs are non stop believe me your fans will love you for it and i think you know that,positive
s a this episode is brilliant dont waste your time on this one,positive
i love all of his movies and wish there were more,positive
take someone you love or want to love and go see this film well done,positive
i really enjoyed this film this film works on every level,positive
its not a great film but its an interesting and entertaining thriller the character development is very well done and i could know the characters very well its not memorable at all but its entertaining,positive
it is well told and well thought out i could go on really,positive
yes i loved this movie when i was a kid for the good old times you know,positive
i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story this is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children not bad but could have been much better,positive
and i found it hilarious think again there is plenty to laugh at,positive
here is one the entire family will enjoy youll all keep coming back for this one,positive
this movie is excellent and a great sci fi action movie,positive
by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isnt so much gay,positive
not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece,positive
then the two of them go home have sex and he leaves,positive
this movie is a true masterpiece it really is chance who wouldnt love a dog like chance,positive
the acting is superb you can see that the actors enjoyed making this film,positive
only when he gets there just to check her out,positive
i just watched it and watched it and i still do today the art is beautiful the songs are well okay and the voice acting is better than some things today all in all you just have to see this movie it is a great masterpiece although its very hard to find today,positive
the characters are very strong and it gives the show a lot of power this show is easily one of the best shows on television,positive
be that as it may there are still things to enjoy,positive
since i have a huge and stupid note the word stupid sense of humor i found this movie absolutely hilarious i was also surprised at the acting these people actually did a good job,positive
but this is not a musical after all and the last scene is my favorite romantic,positive
believe me i have seen much much worse than this and the death scenes are cool too,positive
ive seen a lot too it was an all around good movie i would recommend it but not for kids,positive
this is one of the best horror movies ive seen in a while who could ask for anything more in a horror movie this one keeps it pretty simple and does just that,positive
than were left looking at the screen like no they didnt good performances all around,positive
theres a point to be made here a i say it feels real,positive
i found it hilarious but then i thought well why but its great if you havent seen it do so,positive
once again i liked all the songs and of course i loved the songs ten stars for a very good movie,positive
who knew still watch this without trying to go too deep really,positive
i have never seen anything like it i mean when a person doesnt know who mr t theres something about it at the time i saw the show i couldnt remember who mr t now i know who he is and that just makes it so much more funny please watch it,positive
i hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen,positive
great cast with just fine acting its truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weird cinema,positive
i loved it when i first saw it and i love it still,positive
the acting isnt amazing but i didnt find it bad at any point,positive
i really thought this wasnt that bad always with a list actors but just not always a hit,positive
one is rich important and has no real love outside of money first off i love the actors in this film,positive
this is a extremely well made film the acting script and camera work are all first rate the entire cast does an excellent job with the script,positive
the story is great mr the supporting cast is perfect,positive
definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years,positive
i am surprised this didnt make it into general release,positive
its amazing how entertaining these films are theres superb music through the whole film and the actors are quite good better than usual in these type of films,positive
it was around that point i started to sit up and pay more attention,positive
they put in new songs and scenes she does a good job with the role and the music,positive
but as entertainment goes it does a good job so overall its worth seeing but not especially great,positive
but this is played for laughs in the movie making both the comedy better and the drama better,positive
ok sure there is plenty of action in this flick but also some thought and heart or two,positive
etc i may be the only person who really liked this flick b,positive
however if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life this film is for you if you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you,positive
i really liked man of the year even though i was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film as far as acting goes i think everyone involved did a good job it does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama i really liked the fact that this film that this film wasnt a typical hollywood film it tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me,positive
i still wonder why i watched this movie still for some reason or another i decided to watch it not expecting much overall i recommend this film to almost everyone,positive
i love this and love it more each time i watch it,positive
or can we and he is about to learn that sometimes there is simply no going back but its worth it,positive
because there is a lot of voice over work sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt the effects are fine,positive
i have seen this movie three times youre one of the best,positive
she did it like she knew what she was doing thats one of my many favorite parts in that movie im like her,positive
i loved this movie so much she is a good actress the movie was great she gets in,positive
but the film has many things to recommend it b,positive
how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong but you are not sure why one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen,positive
the cinematography is among the best of any film a must see movie for any true movie fan this is just a great movie one that can be watched over and over again,positive
this movie surprised me this is a movie you can watch over again say,positive
it was everything i would expect out of a movie i just loved it absolutely amazing loved it,positive
i hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out,positive
this is the only short on the dvd i liked but i dont just like it i love it it is simply beautiful,positive
please if you get the chance watch this movie you wont be sorry,positive
i find nothing wrong with that the show is not perfect,positive
i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance,positive
but not so he was perfect watch this youll see what i mean,positive
i was never a big fan of horror movies it was well acted and had a great story,positive
many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch since they feel that it isnt realistic that happens all the time until i thought more,positive
i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies i think thats the point,positive
this was it i would have never expected the ending if i didnt already know the behind the scenes stuff,positive
but is a part of a reality group for the whole family he wants to leave and it is done in a truly beautiful way,positive
this flick was right on the money and a wonderful experience to watch,positive
it had its great moments too but i didnt realize how sad it was,positive
ive known a few in my life who would go back and stay if they could high school the first time was bad enough whats a girl to do,positive
how interesting that this was made by a british director,positive
by god its been a long time since i saw this,positive
i really enjoyed watching this movie if you see the movie i hope youll like it,positive
if you are interested in this era dont miss this series,positive
hilarious enough said its not going to move you or anything but its an extremely enjoyable movie was a great success,positive
this is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all,positive
not often is it that i get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one time,positive
i watch this movie every time it plays on tv a simply brilliant film,positive
to them it wasnt sexual but that was often all that came of it yes very sad those children didnt know what sex was the parents knew that both those of the children in the movie and those watching it this sometimes can be for the best but i truly believe this movie isnt one of them,positive
as a matter of fact they didnt at least so its seems we do not see that she is alone and there they are again,positive
overall i actually liked this film how is it cool,positive
what you dont want to hear it the two main characters are meant for each other in a strange way and we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say but also what they really mean,positive
i am sure this movie looked great in the big screen but it is also the kind of movie that plays well on dvd dont miss it,positive
not a great movie by any means but definitely a fun one,positive
i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot i believe this is just such a great show if you dont like it,positive
this movie is one of those that is so bad its good its good but not great,positive
nothing is as it first seems lots of suspense great acting from mr,positive
it starts a little slow but give it a chance this movie is more about lines than plot,positive
in short its a classic film that doesnt take itself too seriously and doesnt want the audience to either,positive
i just saw this movie for the second time one is that it is based on a true story,positive
there are lots of funny moments in the film but this is just my opinion as for me i highly enjoyed the film,positive
until and watching it back now the animation is terrible great classic kids film,positive
what surprised me most about seeing other people was how funny it is we see how the couple works through this strange situation,positive
most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles a good watch,positive
go figure without him the movie would be very average indeed,positive
pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci fi t show its fun to watch,positive
since this is the main plot it gets the most screen time that must be it right,positive
what a class bit of british cinema its about time oh well,positive
there is really not much id need or want to say here,positive
this is a really great series they so needed to be together james,positive
youre never sure of who is exactly who in this movie,positive
no one makes films like this why he has not made more films like this i have no idea,positive
an amazing film ive only just seen it and i already want to see it again,positive
for years i thought we were the only ones who saw it a must see,positive
true love i truly enjoyed and loved this movie i just saw it on dvd true love,positive
i dont know why but i enjoy watching it i already own the first one oh well i still own it,positive
we get to see them make fun of the events in the first film so doesnt this sound fun maybe not now but go watch it for yourself the fact that its not that serious in its plot makes it the more enjoyable,positive
i have watched two episodes so far i really like it so the picture quality is very good they could easily make this a good film i dont think that i have seen anything like this on tv before,positive
hope so keep them coming great film well written realistic characters,positive
you all know it its still a lot of fun,positive
the acting is good the action is good and so is the plot just sit back and enjoy,positive
i could go on but simply i cant recommend this film highly enough,positive
id love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject,positive
whats his name clear i loved the film back then and i love it today,positive
it is a nice comedy and the special effects watch it,positive
cast was great he was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person,positive
these two characters would not have had much to do with each other,positive
dont get my wrong its not a bad short film you can tell that it has been an act of love for her,positive
in the end you have to make the best of it because there is no other way out,positive
i think that the movie was kind of weird in the opening scene a person is killed for no reason the special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie,positive
its very obvious that i enjoy this movie a lot,positive
she turns instead to dr she can always stay at my place this is a really well made film dr ok now about the effects its all about the effects isnt it its so sad the ending scene also deserves a mention wonderful stuff if you like effects youll love this movie every good movie has a great song behind it not perfect but really well made if you havent watched it you really should today it is a must watch,positive
they are fantastic people who are incredibly funny i miss you guys and hope you are well joe,positive
its just god and its really funny but as a plot it works well at least you dont think that when you see her,positive
the shows are an hour long each and i think there are four of them all together at least ive only seen four of them s,positive
this film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast,positive
this is very nearly a perfect film could anything be more true dont miss the soundtrack it is wonderful,positive
the acting was very good hot women and some scary parts,positive
i didnt expect much from this movie it was just one of those movies i thought id just watch because it was on television i was very happy with the acting they had the characters played well it really makes you think about people every actor did great at acting it was real nice for a change it was a great movie and i would definitely say i recommend it,positive
this movie is good first thing first the story is actually good my problem is theres too many characters the music is also excellent,positive
imagine how i felt at that time the comedy series,positive
i love this film is very romantic the soundtrack is beautiful,positive
i would love to see him in more movies of this nature if you havent seen this movie you must by the way the soundtrack is great too,positive
this film in particular shows us one of the best british films from that or any other era he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie mr,positive
thing is you need to fight your way into being like the others and a scary one that might get to other kids,positive
on the whole this movie although it was shot on a very small budget looks great is very well put together and features excellent acting and directing,positive
but the rest of the cast is superb too but its exactly what this picture is,positive
the actors did a great job i look forward to seeing more of him on the big screen,positive
sure you could ask why didnt she just get out of that town okay but then the film would be over within a half hour,positive
but also because he is not the main actor that kids performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone great movie go see it,positive
really this sort of thing is not easy to do great writing great acting great directing,positive
one of the two best films of the year highly enjoyable,positive
but it finally got to me who are you who are you who are you who are you who are you are you a man who are you who are you who are you i dont think ill go on much about the plot if theres a problem with the script thats it but i dont care about that,positive
i couldnt believe it was on such a short time wish i could remember the last episode i probably didnt see it anyway sure would be great if it came out on dvd but i dont think that many people even knew about it what a shame,positive
there were some great new talent id never heard of the leads before anyway was especially good,positive
i cant wait to see more of him shes really pretty,positive
i dont know you tell me however not for lack of trying,positive
that is not to say there are not some great performances here as are most people,positive
the footage is fantastic and so is the way it was put together ive seen some of them several times there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer,positive
somehow they came up with this masterpiece its got everything who knows but do watch it and youll see what i mean,positive
the fighting in this picture is really some of the greatest i have seen,positive
i thought this movie was really good he goes to her and tries to bring her home,positive
i liked the plot and the idea of the movie and i especially liked the cast who wouldnt,positive
but come on this film is a masterpiece but this one deserves it,positive
this movie is amazing no i think its yes its this is not that movie,positive
usually there just drama or comedy movies in the horror genre is or was totally new at that time its possible but difficult,positive
the title of this film nearly put me off watching it,positive
she starts to romance him but quickly falls in love the acting is for the most part very good worth seeing,positive
oh well let me get back to the game at hand,positive
just when you think you cant take any more it gives you more,positive
does anyone know if hes played in over movies or tv shows,positive
without big turns in the plot but the main problem with this movie is about the script a romantic comedy its not clear,positive
not to say the movie is bad because it isnt the book is just a little bit better,positive
finally other people who have actually seen this show it is just hilarious or maybe not,positive
the film is based on the lives of real people,positive
i guess im just that stupid i love the serious look that hes got going on its quite hot,positive
and very few people were named but all in all an enjoyable film and im surprised its not seen more often,positive
i enjoyed this film for what it was an entertaining film great scene and believe me she does it again in this one,positive
its also at the same time among one of the better ones,positive
i have never read the book but had always heard good things about it it is one of the best i have ever seen,positive
they will break down what the guy did wrong and what they guy did right ive seen weak game ive seen strong game and this show is for real no doubt,positive
thats the way this movie is this movie is just wonderful im going to have to find a copy to buy,positive
it feels like it needs to be done id buy it even with more action this is still not an action flick ill watch it often,positive
later i watched it every time it was shown on tv and want to watch more beautiful beautiful beautiful i should not even comment them my comment is only about the original,positive
the supporting cast could form a series of their own they are that good,positive
although it seems hard to believe all of it happened actually the reality was even worse than the movie yes the screenplay is not full of action but life is not either excellent movie highly recommend,positive
i really liked the acting in this film but lets just say that i wasnt disappointed there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time,positive
i dont have a favorite episode i just like certain scenes,positive
what can i say everything you could wish for was in it basically whats up my man,positive
he did not get enough roles like this during his long career this is his best performance this film is definitely worth a look,positive
if youre looking for an original horror flick this might be the one for you when dr the plot among other things makes this movie really interesting the problems with the movie overall this movie is amazing to look at,positive
best of all its one of the few tv shows on today thats actually funny im sure it would help but the material is funny enough in its own right but the show doesnt stop there but thats not a problem because the show still works definitely check this show out,positive
film of the year for me so far and yes ive seen a few,positive
however this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one,positive
i love this show show in the history of film tv its amazing season after season the show gets better and better id say though that it turned out just fine maybe even better,positive
mr etc as a result the whole sequence seems dull the audience should feel at this point along with michael that maybe they are going crazy,positive
this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think youve seen something special,positive
there is action in it but thats not really what its about but again thats not what its about,positive
this is one more example he also has a interesting voice,positive
first off i didnt know what to expect when i started the video thats not the case here that has to be seen and just try and keep a straight face very well done,positive
its a good movie but not one of their best,positive
but its only the body of this movie you only feel what happened with these boys,positive
it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well,positive
the relationship between the main characters i thought was very realistic how the two end up involved is believable definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie i loved it great scene,positive
although i really enjoyed the film as a whole i do feel that it was too long i needed several,positive
but come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women but thats ok we all have a dark side,positive
this movie is great the writing directing and acting are brilliant,positive
then it became a musical and you cant help but feel that in film form it never really left the stage and they certainly didnt beautiful you wont,positive
this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it,positive
what can i say you will love this game and if you dont too bad,positive
i love this film but its not without its bad points but everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems thats a shame,positive
while this movie is not the most entertaining in the world i think it is better than most over all i mean it had its little laughs and just all around a good feeling id recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one,positive
if anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this one i say pretty please write back because i miss the series,positive
s any gun can play lives up to its title,positive
everyone is cool all the time they dont even seem to have personal lives,positive
i really enjoyed this if you are a fan of the original tv series then i am sure you will enjoy this,positive
well not actually this movie is very entertaining though in fact all the characters are great,positive
despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs,positive
well its not really there or at least not very well worked out,positive
they obviously know their future too so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present,positive
it is great family fun that the kids love and the parents enjoy as well i wish more films like this were made anyone who doesnt enjoy this movie doesnt have any children or never was a kid them self,positive
i just wish he had more time with her and their baby i didnt really understand that because they had little time together it was a wonderful movie and cast,positive
before viewing please make sure you have seen night of the living dead what more do you need,positive
yes you heard me the story works wonderful the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job,positive
so much for that you know hollywood then at the last there is the little boy remember the little boy,positive
tv one of the most original films ive seen in years,positive
lost is an extremely well made tv series about some people that are lost on an island i have a review on that too that you could check it out,positive
this film shows you what happened on the inside we must never forget,positive
i am still a fan i mean it can always be worse,positive
please check this video out if you can find it,positive
however that being said all you need to do is go back to the book but thats hollywood,positive
the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it,positive
the music is fun and the animation is wonderful another sequel i hope so,positive
this show is good etc they all did great in the show,positive
i think best is yet to come fire is ok but still good days are yet to come,positive
this is one of the best war films ever why not this one,positive
this movie was one of the best i have ever seen you will not be disappointed,positive
i have never seen a show as good as full house anyone who has never seen it which i dont see how it is possible should see it it is a great show for anyone of any age the plot of the show is very believable he is great it was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break most young kids cant do this full house is where they got their start full house is a great show for everyone,positive
i do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on i dont get it i,positive
i really liked this movie maybe i think no a really good movie,positive
i use imdb very much and i think this is his best one it was his last one if you have just come back to it,positive
and it is all true this is the film to see,positive
i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies you have to see it two or three times to get it all in all the characters are great they do not give away all the good jokes oh and one more thing,positive
it is one of the few true stories that made it to film that i really like great movie,positive
this is one of those movies whos heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again,positive
i have since watched this movie several times gets better each time,positive
man that was hard i would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance and he wants his dog back so see it,positive
how could a film like that get more attention than this one,positive
watch him and you will laugh and learn you wont find one weak moment,positive
and whats the story line the girls are sure game then this is true its great,positive
this is not perfect it is a movie after all i thought that was so cool,positive
well you know what i mean of course since they had dr worth seeing,positive
pay attention please because i had to look this up its a success but once is not enough the acting is pretty good too,positive
i really enjoyed girl fight it something i could watch over and over again the movie is showing how women should stand up for what they want to do in life the love story was a part that i really enjoyed in the movie also,positive
with beautiful music throughout the movie the sounds and music can make you feel like youre in the movie,positive
there was one problem though lets just say it was worth the wait i dont know why i love this movie so much a,positive
mr the acting is good under mr we wish mr,positive
i thought this was a very good movie it is a good story and the acting is amazing i guess it is a drama that is the world we live in i liked it i think you will too,positive
the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent,positive
such a pretty little girl her acting was superb as well true to life and very human either way she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving i read the plot on the back and then thought that well maybe id look it up on imdb first and then come back and rent it at a later time this is truly a wonderful movie,positive
i wanted to live in this world and never leave it,positive
definitely not to be taken too seriously but just enjoyed,positive
i absolutely love this film everything about it it almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen,positive
i watched part one two days ago and today i saw part two,positive
but what the hell happened in the end i mean dont get me wrong i liked the film,positive
its not bad not great but thats something else dr dr however side from that the picture isnt at all bad though much like a comic book dr ive seen lots worse,positive
this movie has a decent story in my opinion very good fight scenes but i was a little bit disappointed by the end of the movie,positive
i think this is a great show with good actors for the most part it has a good storyline and plot i like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out it wasnt predictable like most stories on most shows,positive
and yet dont even look at him shes truly little no shes true to the book,positive
she may not be the greatest actress in the world but shes rather good in this,positive
how many films can say that not even many big ones script is good so you are not going to go how much is true the usual based on a true story makes me think it should mostly be true i guess we know why end of movie,positive
she is more a bad girl and thats what i like about her i think this movie was a little slow at the ending but was well done i recommend it to be seen,positive
so far so stupid it is funny then youll have a good time,positive
and the music is out of this world ill be watching it again just to hear the music great actor just coming into his own the good and the bad in his characters,positive
if you take movies seriously this is not for you it has some really funny parts hilarious actually need i say more,positive
he is an amazing actor why i didnt see that as the case here theres no movie there the boys wanted to be involved it was a game maybe however this is a movie,positive
it is one of the few movies that gets better the more times you see it it is that superb,positive
i dont know how many times i have seen this sequence but its funny every time,positive
fine dr well you know but also quite of bit of it was taken up with things that just didnt make any sense to me,positive
this review has been written by someone who has read it several times and knows what they are talking about and the scene at the end is beautiful,positive
i read the play before i saw the movie and loved them both but who cannot be seen by the other characters in the film terrible shame to have lost him so young,positive
certainly the best this year until now it is as simple a story for a movie as it can get this is not about things and people that have gone bad,positive
when i first saw it i was really disappointed now i see it as a good little drama,positive
this film is really good anyone interested should definitely check it out,positive
okay but come on classic no bad parts yes entertaining big yes are you fast,positive
none of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does,positive
this is a slow film but not too slow it is still good but not fantastic,positive
i absolutely loved this series and was very sad to see it go it was good for the entire family and was interesting for the entire family which was a huge plus it was my favorite show at the time and will always be near the top of my list i hope it comes out on dvd,positive
evil he is evil each season is completely brilliant in its own way,positive
i wasnt sure when i heard about this coming out i was wrong i found it to be very good it was very funny not to give anything way but youll know what i am talking about it was a very good movie over all,positive
this is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two check it out,positive
sometimes these are one of the same yes it did,positive
should he do it and get the money to go,positive
the tv was on there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to,positive
i had never seen the original death wish in the book either death wish i film for about the cast i think everyone was good and get through their role she didnt look like the main character she could have more role to appear thats like a joke in another case the ending scene of the movie set back me,positive
this documentary is a must see for all movie fans,positive
it was also very romantic i love this movie i highly recommend this movie,positive
when he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film i felt good for him the only thing i dont like about the film is the ending,positive
i had a strong feeling she came from the theater so i looked her up here and surprise im right well be seeing a lot more of her work no doubt,positive
there are two ways to turn a tv series into a film,positive
this was one of the first creepy movies i ever saw now thats a movie,positive
great film to view and enjoy especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors,positive
as well lead us to think better in the way we must understand our children because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present time,positive
then things get strange lets see and its all a comedy he was right still its a great film,positive
its also about being true to yourself i really liked this movie,positive
i too have been looking for a copy it should be re released,positive
a very good film indeed he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies still it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once,positive
okay ill admit that if i didnt have kids i never would have seen this film and would never see it so if you are looking for a film to see with your kids you certainly could do a lot worse,positive
but then what else would you expect with a title like that there is not a lot of dialogue in the film who knows,positive
thats the beauty of it though and what sets it apart you get it all you dont even see it coming,positive
some good action here and there and some blood and violence as well,positive
i just watched sure i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film but it makes you forget that then you should really see this movie simply wonderful,positive
he just looks too much like a kid in this role and the story itself,positive
i have been looking for this movie for so many years what a waste it was a very good movie,positive
who is the thing all of the actors give strong realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character dont miss it,positive
the two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words,positive
it was the best movie i saw all day by a long shot,positive
that was all done in the tv show check it out,positive
you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it this is also a good family movie for the most part,positive
it as what all those films dont it will be one of the best horror films you will see all year,positive
but you know what im sure a lot of writers are like that,positive
the fact that he makes it look like its easy doesnt mean that it is,positive
cant remember the last time i had so much fun watching a documentary,positive
the plot of this film is ridiculous too im surprised by the low rating on here,positive
its easy to make really general comments about a film like this,positive
although the beginning of the movie in new york takes too long the movie is a must see for people who like this genre,positive
this movie is about so much more than that the straight story is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives,positive
this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs enjoy,positive
of course this makes it a novel about love just make sure you read the book after you see the movie,positive
and well she does everything to get just that i was alone in cinema when i watched this one i myself liked it very much the acting was between very good to excellent especially the main actors where brilliant if you like this kind of movies try this one,positive
i cant understand why this movie doesnt get more air time also the supporting cast is wonderful as well enjoy,positive
i meant that in a good way believe me all good,positive
i found myself thinking thats pretty cool why did they do that i thought the film was fun interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think,positive
they try to put into a few words everything they are and expect,positive
i really cant recommend this one enough check it out,positive
a simple plot but the movie just makes you feel good,positive
i too loved there being no score i recommend it to the whole family,positive
its a very funny film although i dont think it nearly one of his best,positive
i enjoyed the film all so they can comment on how bad they are if you dont like his work dont watch it,positive
but overall this movie worked im surprised at the low rating for this,positive
i always hate when actors are not believable in action parts i hope theres more,positive
its not only the story its the music the acting both by young and old,positive
hes lost and has no idea how to do much of anything so much happens that not enough time is spent on anything,positive
as was the case for me please stop reading and rent view this film,positive
really excellent movie one of the best ive seen great actors and cast the movie really gets you into the feeling of the movie nice nice nice,positive
the movie wasnt all that great the book is better but the movie wasnt all that bad either it was interesting to say the least the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldnt say i was actually interested in the movie itself,positive
its a brilliant film i think it was really funny and it will be a well known comedy they were really great people i would like to meet them again one day,positive
this has got to be one of the best episodes of doctor who that ive seen since it came back last year,positive
it is he who wants to die i would think not does it show up the worth of our love,positive
you might not like it at all thats your opinion and thats fine,positive
i would give each actor an oscar great great movie just brilliant the story was beautiful and sad at the same time,positive
both my wife and i loved it and we will watch it again in a few years im sure,positive
they just have it so there you have it i recommend you do the same its much more entertaining to watch the series this way let me know if you had it too,positive
well watch the movie and youll see mother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made,positive
i hate the character there is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes,positive
when the bad guy eventually turns up in person he was definitely not what i expected to see all in all i wouldnt go out of your way for this one but if you like the genre then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill i guess,positive
he does not these are the ones to get if you can find a copy anyway back to the story and dr its a shame that very few actually know that,positive
i was so wrong the second story is scary too but not in the same way as the first one the third story my favorite is really really creepy,positive
it might be a documentary but it is really good,positive
so sit back with this movie let reality go for a little while and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half,positive
simply one of the best movies ever if you wont get it sorry for you not now but in the far future,positive
people are being too hard on the film then the fun begins as everyone about him also go down id love to get a copy of it to view it again,positive
to find out what i mean youll have to watch it for yourself,positive
the entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable,positive
the good earth is a great movie that makes it really great there should be a re make for this very nice movie,positive
as if there could be a bad one and mr,positive
you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it,positive
i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends,positive
and usually hes just himself throughout most of his movies you will never forget these characters once youve seen this movie,positive
but then every once in a while something happens i just thought it was the best piece of tv i have seen for a long while,positive
this is one of my most favorite movies of all time,positive
this is such a great film never mind the low rating here i really cant think of anything bad to say about it maybe it has to be your type of thing but i saw this with my sister and my mother and we all were taken by it the acting was also very good and that is hard to do in a film like this it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy but i absolutely had no problem with that this time but i guess the title already kind of gives that away good job,positive
go figure very often its quite easy for us to forget were actually watching a movie and isnt that what true art is supposed to be all about,positive
everyone out there will like it now that i think about it there is quite a bit of action in this movie i loved it,positive
saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later the cast was excellent i really enjoyed it,positive
four years later hes released all in all not your typical horror film,positive
if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it in my opinion its a piece of art,positive
it is funny and sad at the same time maybe that is why i liked the film so much,positive
and i really mean that i must add that it has a killer soundtrack,positive
i liked the movie a real lot a very cool change in plot when you least expect it,positive
but if you are looking for real people with real stories this is the film for you,positive
i cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here great cast and an overall great movie,positive
i think thats important for kids to see and try to understand still worth it if they can sit still,positive
from the moment the music begins it is by far better than anything ive heard in years i think it may be the best ive ever heard,positive
i cant say this show is perfect this show is by far one of the better original shows they say stupid crap oh wait,positive
still there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours,positive
and it is very funny it wasnt supposed to be a realistic documentary and it isnt like the show it goes in totally different way but that doesnt mean it is bad,positive
for anyone who may not know what a one actor movie was like this is the best example this plot is ridiculous and really makes no sense you name it,positive
if you do enjoy the romance of two girls this isnt one of the best films to watch would recommend it to everyone,positive
this movie has a real feel to it definitely worth seeing buy the dvd,positive
no wonder she was up for an oscar i give this one a ten,positive
the acting is great in the movie im going to have to see it again when it comes out because it was that good i cant say one bad thing about the movie,positive
and that one was okay not as good as the first one,positive
it almost became a joke i dont know why it was always turned down it just was no movie has ever made me laugh so hard and i doubt any movie ever will i think thats all i can say,positive
and it was great great great you should see it,positive
i was dead wrong its still brilliant because this is in no way supposed to be taken seriously,positive
seriously it had everything you could want in a movie everything dont know what its about but its good to go i am not one of you,positive
theres a guy michael and his girlfriend left him with out a word he wants to know what happened is she ok,positive
the movie also features some fine supporting actors and some fine acting throughout,positive
the character actors in this film were a great plus also sad,positive
they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script no problem they did it through the power of their music i saw this film at a very important time in my life sex like everyone else did was this a good movie,positive
surprise she couldnt remember so i told her to see the movie maybe a bit high but its so worth seeing,positive
the story is well written and directed who wouldnt want her as a mother,positive
i have to say this movie is absolutely amazing i dont understand why it got such a low rating great movie,positive
good but not great in a way i feel it could have been that bit better,positive
is it a murder mystery its never totally realistic so what but wait he has seen it all who did it me yes because you and i are two of a kind when it comes to women well never have a chance,positive
but thats ok did i say buy its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it once youve even so much as heard the title to this film you must see it,positive
from the first shot you know the movie is going to be something special,positive
if not then stay away well with all the attention ive gave this subject,positive
loved this movie if you get the chance to watch it see it,positive
it is about time this film was released on dvd can anything be done,positive
this is the best movie ever but that is my opinion some say its cheesy but i think it is truly a beautiful film if you have never seen this film when you do you will understand what i mean as you can tell i am in love with this film and i know you will be too,positive
this is the best series of its type ive seen all year the stories arent all that memorable but thats not the reason i watch shows like this one,positive
the excellent acting was mostly done by people involved in tv or it was their first movie give up your day job,positive
but that wasnt it for new york city id do anything its a great great movie town,positive
i have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure,positive
ive never written that word before but it comes to mind here let me look it up something like that exactly id say definitely definitely watch at least half an hour of this,positive
although this movie isnt for everyone this is a great comedy,positive
it is no different for boys but we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that,positive
i just love watching women like these on screen no ones perfect,positive
ive watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it,positive
you have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all the movie is anything but boring you will either hate it or love it,positive
but i just love this type of movie cant help myself,positive
he just needs someone to show him the way not a problem here,positive
was it a movie a documentary both actually anyway its yet an old story i saw it a short while ago i found a masterpiece the only words i want to add is about my own experience with this film if you can feel it if you can see it,positive
i own this movie i am actually from the same town as the brother directors but that doesnt make the film any better,positive
mr shes not a woman thats too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over and like it,positive
the theme song often goes through my head after all these years,positive
i dont want to give away any more of the plot,positive
and it certainly works if you can watch these two films this one first,positive
i have never seen it since then but have thought of it often is that possible with television movies i really would love to see it again,positive
it has been years since i have seen it and would love to get a copy,positive
they have some really good actors in this thing i can tell hes going to be big cant wait for the next episode,positive
this is a funny film and i like it a lot the humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part but still works well a comedy for a night when you dont want to have to think much its well worth a rent,positive
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch,positive
this film has so many good things i cant even say them,positive
the cast is great the film has a powerful style strange beautiful to look at definitely worth seeing i really would like to see it again i cant wait to see the film again in the cinema or on dvd,positive
i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are but everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is living,positive
the animation was beautiful although there were a couple parts that did not look good,positive
you will laugh while watching this movie her kids will have a high i as well but she does not knows what she wants the cinematography is nice,positive
if you havent see this movie you havent seen the best musical of all time seriously,positive
thats right i said it but what are men like these we all are these guys know what women like again only the ones who have game and even the ones who are bad they are worth a laugh we could say this about any other shows though couldnt we,positive
who can forget some of the best lines in film history,positive
once you watch an episode it never really comes to mind ever again,positive
mr there seems to be so much question about this last characters side story mr and they might even get away with it,positive
but then i really cant think of a better title for the film i wonder why,positive
im not a big musical fan but this is one of the few i really love,positive
havent heard from the people involved since which is a surprise,positive
had fun watching this film it felt like that pretty much throughout the film to me,positive
some are weird some crazy and otherwise but they all make the movie good,positive
i like this film and believe that you will too,positive
this movie is hard to find but its worth watching it,positive
i must say that i really had no idea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie i guess it was the fact that i had nothing better to do between class but something about this movie really did it for me i would now see myself as a huge fan me give it a chance it wont let you down,positive
this is one of the great movies of all time,positive
and then mr mr at any rate theres somewhat of a twist to this and kind but weird mr,positive
the feel of this movie was amazing his character was really interesting this movie is definitely worth the watch,positive
finally we get a tv series where we get to see the acting talent episode one was excellent,positive
they did an excellent job on this film what a light entertaining and truly enjoyable movie,positive
her character will definitely make you laugh others will watch this movie and learn hate him,positive
two years later much more funny and entertaining than the original,positive
this movie is a piece of the time in which it was made realistic at least thats how it seemed at the time there would definitely not be this ending however realistic,positive
i think its a great horror sci fi film anyway i really like this film which surprised me you need to see it to believe it,positive
ive loved this movie for a long time i guess its because i saw it when i was so young unless of course they have a young heart,positive
i just never got around to watching it enough about me what a fun film those people know how to have a good time i highly recommend it,positive
the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling all in all a good movie with very good actors,positive
although other movies are not far behind a must watch,positive
it was just as if they were people i need to see this movie again,positive
this brings me back to my first point bring it back,positive
how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me i loved this show before i even saw it,positive
we actually care when people are killed in this film at the same time this is also a fun movie,positive
his name is joe a long battle begins against this man young this is not a perfect movie but i recommend it,positive
the cinematography is excellent as expected worth trying at least on dvd if not at the movies,positive
thats what makes this original zombie movie so good go rent it,positive
as he says you come to me because im your father,positive
it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters this makes it a more interesting film go and see it,positive
thats terrible i hate how we never find out how everyone ends up bring it back i loved the entire cast too,positive
my son has been watching them for over a year are you being serious the parents should get over it they have talent the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show this show is by far the best show on tv for kids how amazing is that where did you hear that from leave him alone,positive
it certainly wouldnt have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time,positive
of course i was i got to like them but i knew they were this movie as good as it was made me feel bad,positive
i have watched this movie on dvd a couple of times now the first time i watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour,positive
sort of a mystery hes an amazing talent and a good man i wish them all well its such a shame it didnt,positive
i saw this movie when i was a little girl and i have enjoyed it every time its a different version than we are used to today but who says there is one way its a fun movie to watch bad,positive
this movie is pretty good but first i thought that it was the original film the same as they did with the first film but with other episodes but still it is a pretty good film but i still think that it is pretty good the actors and special effects were good if you havent seen it go see it,positive
but for those of you and you know who you are who did live it you know exactly what i am talking about do it job well done,positive
but i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death i was inside you its called back up but thats what i think an thought about the movie,positive
then again what do i know im only a child,positive
theyre amazing a i i believe this movie has a good plot and is well done despite what a lot of people say go see this film,positive
this is a feel good movie as good as they come then my wife and i enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen this is entertainment,positive
the plot is much better than some that are made today,positive
its hard to review or comment on a movie that youre only able to see half of,positive
how the police work with the political party being what it was its been a while since i saw this movie the first time,positive
i loved the entire film i think the movie could have been fine without the sex but it worked somehow overall an amazing movie,positive
an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd,positive
this is really a good movie to anyone who has not seen this movie and is thinking about it they better go and see it because it is really good i love the part when the boy found out about the girl and from then on i was just all into this movie,positive
its exactly what i expected from it and very well done,positive
when i say it is a wonderful small film i dont mean budget or quality,positive
one of the more memorable films ive seen in a long while fantastic performances all around,positive
when i finally saw it i took a good surprise the movie isnt great thing but its very fun and the action scenes are very well done,positive
i thought that the storyline came into place very well i liked this movie a lot i rather enjoyed the movie i want it to be my very first dvd for my room thats how much i like it,positive
i have seen this movie this is the major change in the society,positive
to avoid that i am not going to talking the story here i read the book first and then watched the dvd later it really worth watching,positive
a guy thing may not be a classic but it sure is a good funny comedy of course not every comedy is perfect,positive
i didnt think id like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather on the slow side what are they give way well maybe one more,positive
in a kids movie it just sounds weird one thing that keeps this down is that its a musical its sad but happy but more sad than happy and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel this is one of the few movies i feel this way about but i do,positive
seriously i loved this film i had started to read the book and i loved it the storyline is very cool and interesting it is very similar to the book i find this film to be not the least bit boring i absolutely loved it,positive
the film itself i believe is quite a masterpiece its the kind of film that people should be making the ending is kind of silly though but i still think its one of my favorite movies,positive
i also really liked the characters within this movie it has really got to be one of the greatest female roles i have ever seen even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great original special little movie that deserves to be seen by more,positive
just not how we might think it should end it is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it no matter how many times that is,positive
or so they thought this movie takes place about a year after the second this movie has it all then theres the actors this movie isnt scary but is is hilarious out,positive
of course the girls in the film are lots of fun to watch too,positive
who but war there is this war does not end it is another dark age that future is the third act i believe mr,positive
all in all great season though and i cant wait for the next a,positive
but the best thing about it as well as seeing each episode is how they made it,positive
and his character was much different than his other roles overall this was a good movie,positive
im not a big fan of watching films over and over again but i cant wait for this to come out for all to buy,positive
what really makes a horror movie is the violence once again i wont give anything away,positive
interesting film but very long in the end though i would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you,positive
the dialog is dead on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect then you want a thriller this is a romantic comedy,positive
then it will all be sad this film is the best for sure,positive
most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller is the style the story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work there are some nice character portrayed by a good cast,positive
the music of this movie is perfect a feel good romantic love story,positive
down to earth is the best movie it has a good plot and its unique it isnt like those movies that are all the same with the similar story lines and its not all comedy and no story this movie also has a very good ending,positive
i love this show you need to watch this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before one of my favorite shows of all time but theres never been an episode i didnt like all of the episodes are absolutely hilarious,positive
the movie was very moving it was truly an enjoyable night out this is a must see movie,positive
i have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there excellent work overall the movie is great i would love to watch this film again and again an excellent film and a must see,positive
there were superb performances there was never a dull boring moment so totally well worth watching this one it kept me interested right up until the end and for me there isnt many movies that can do that these days,positive
this was a great movie so what makes a movie great the point is it is one of the best movies of its type ive seen,positive
not even us i dont know how to do this by myself i recommend this film,positive
however this being said hes made a lot of films and ive seen just a few so is the story ridiculous back to the plot what great movies should be a bit long but worth it,positive
i saw this movie when it first came out she just wanted her family together he was power crazy,positive
i would kill to be able to see this great movie on the big screen,positive
then i got to looking at their body of work it was a good movie though not for everyone,positive
if you get the chance see this it is excellent,positive
ok i have seen just about everything thats what this did to me and for my money this is much better than last house on the left completely stupid its a classic,positive
i like the show but come on writers get some action in it,positive
a lot of what happens on screen is incredibly difficult to make out i doubt you will ever forget it i sure know that i wont,positive
he can act well and thats come to be expected of him so gore fans might be disappointed but story fans will not unfortunately with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film that sequel will never happen is this the best film ive ever seen in my life no yes,positive
boy was i wrong i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one yes right away i have never ever done that,positive
but i just love this movie ive seen it so many times but every time i see it i fall in love with it all over again but im a big romantic and this movie is romantic,positive
but when you watch it you cant help but enjoy it you cant help but to enjoy this movie,positive
the director has done a great work you expect this but something else happens,positive
this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time,positive
a what if fun film it was never meant to be real or serious oh well enjoy,positive
even if you didnt like the film itself its worth seeing just for the soundtrack,positive
well not by anyone that i know of that is all in all bring back the a team was a great documentary style of show,positive
every death scene was like a work of art then theres the direction man theres some really original and beautiful shots on this one great stuff there were very few things i didnt like about this movie not even the police but no this guys really good,positive
white we know him only as much as we see him,positive
i cant say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy given the excellent story the result could have been better though so it is worth watching but could have been done better,positive
there is something about this movie but after all it is a movie not a life story,positive
possibly one of the ten best actors performance that ive ever seen,positive
the plot and much of the dialogue isnt much to write imdb about and for the most part it is why are you even reading these comments,positive
women will like this movie better than men my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me though im not sure why,positive
but what about the story it is interesting even if it feels a little out of place then things begin to get interesting,positive
is back on top i loved this movie just give him his next oscar right now,positive
for me this is a good series anyway if you know his name cool like mr,positive
please see them all dont waste your time watching it i would like to know who to watch,positive
if you go to this movie expecting something it isnt you will be disappointed as with any movie,positive
its a story thats been told before but not like this worth a look see,positive
but its got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect for this kind of thing the acting isnt too bad,positive
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable when youre sure you know the ending surprise great movie,positive
this series was just like what you would expect from mr i loved it and still do,positive
my favorite film this year i wish more films like this were made,positive
his girl simply said that she would help him with the things he wouldnt be able to do but that they would be fine together a true classic,positive
this movie was good for its time this was one of her first movies and she was not bad a lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through imdb,positive
i loved this movie the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going,positive
as a must see and it is a must see,positive
i did not read the book nor do i care to the movie was a beautiful romance and i think women will enjoy it do see this film,positive
first season was excellent and had a good plot so i really wish they could start making new episodes,positive
im not sure how i can make ten lines out of this question but ill try what was the name of the song that was playing and who played it i love that song and i watch the movie over and over just to hear that one song,positive
were very realistic looking forward to the next films when,positive
this is a great film the script is so wonderful i can see why they all wanted to be in it,positive
who i thought it was the best show ever made who went off the air and no one i knew had ever heard of it then i found out there was going to be a new series would the dr yes no no no no this show is wonderful i love the new dr i love the show i hope the next dr is as great as this one,positive
but its one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better,positive
it seemed to me that he put everything he had into it it is a movie that is in love with movies well i did say it was a movie that loved movies,positive
what are you thinking this deserves the full screen experience,positive
oh man why then i saw some episodes and loved it first of all the characters they are all well written and different from each other great then the cast they are all great its too bad it didnt have more than one season it would really be a good show to follow,positive
it one made me laugh by the end of this movie you will feel good watch it as it is and you will enjoy it,positive
why i didnt know what to expect youll love it not perfect it was nice to see a film come a long like this,positive
wonderful now before you ask why am i writing a review ive seen it all why do i watch horror films we all want blood and gore,positive
did i just say that s it goes on that way throughout,positive
well acted directed shot and written less is much better in this case,positive
i found its best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously its perfect for getting out and watching with a group of friends,positive
well lets face it again at the end i hope one would not take this movie for real,positive
at least i did the acting performances are far above average,positive
youll have to see the movie if you want to know why,positive
thats how i feel about rich in love and then its over,positive
this was a great movie all the different stories they had was amazing cant wait for it to come out on dvd,positive
good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time but unfortunately theres no the end i was thinking and i have some idea the most important thing now is the story so why not to play with animation and or even to see just the script,positive
i loved this movie i had never heard of it he had been in real life also so he knew his part someone else killed a man one of them right to the very end,positive
good show it also has good performances from the actors wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something,positive
this is about the best of its genre that i have ever seen i think this is the best part i remember seeing him in,positive
the problem here is the script but not well enough worth a look,positive
you either love it or you hate it and not everyone will like this movie we can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future it is very realistic and well done and it is very difficult to watch,positive
do you think your kids have to know the reality as it is maybe of course the kids must know there is a real life but what do you want for them,positive
dont expect more you wont find it its great fun so enjoy it,positive
but its not like that its far more than that because their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost well its getting better every time,positive
nothing in the lives of these characters really matter not on any human level at least,positive
at the beginning the two really dont like each other even though they have to work together pretty much all the performances here were excellent all in all an excellent piece of work,positive
this movie is much better than just not bad i watched this movie with my kids and then i watched it again by myself a few days later how many movies can you say that about,positive
probably the best movie i have ever seen i watch it over and over again if you want to watch some movie then i clearly recommend this one a must watch movie,positive
i found this film to be a good family film i recommend this picture for the entire family,positive
the rest of the cast was very good also i would definitely recommend this movie,positive
but it is better than many of you have said many of you didnt understand the sense of the movie but anyway as i said before this is not a funny movie but what seemed perfect at the beginning he is lost and doesnt know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy so funny is not a funny movie very hot scenes only a few but this is not a movie for entertainment,positive
i love this movie or is it this is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career s,positive
this is now one of my favorite comedy shows i hope this series has a long run,positive
this is a well done action movie he wasnt meant to be taken seriously just meant to be enjoyed thats all i hope they make another soon,positive
but thats the point right i like it but its hard to recommend,positive
i highly recommend this film movie did i mention its worth watching,positive
this is a great tv movie and worth watching each and every time,positive
i seriously enjoy dr who all im going to say is just try it,positive
overall just as good as the first one and well worth playing,positive
who could forget it was up to the viewer to get the jokes,positive
what can i say go go and get watch it,positive
so who made it and where did it come from no i wouldnt oh the drama maybe im going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say but the more i think about the more the beginning and the ending make sense,positive
it was the movie that made me understand what a good mystery really was of course,positive
this was a great show i remember the mother and the father i too would love to find this on dvd,positive
i have seen this movie and even though i kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning i still liked watching it i would recommend it to other people so please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it i really like her as an actress and person she seems so nice and down to earth but i think he did okay,positive
it actually wasnt half bad not too bad check them both out,positive
that being said the movie is after all a love story,positive
let us start though with how she looks in this film he gives the world hope for the people of power it is one of the greatest scenes in film history,positive
i love this type of comedy i had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title seeing other people i will be watching this one over and over,positive
i love this film and watch it over and over again the rest you already know,positive
and the songs and of course someone does get shot,positive
she was beautiful but what really got to me was how sexual she was classic stuff,positive
i have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film not as good as the book i have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch in that order,positive
i cant say much without giving it away and i dont recommend you actually read that much about this movie before seeing just see it what can i do tell you about the film cant do it please you do the same,positive
apparently great plot absolutely wonderful acting oh yes well ill let you see for yourself excellent direction certainly some people can truly show you a story through their camera while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera great all around in short go see this movie enjoy the show,positive
however as a monster character it never really comes to life,positive
i found it much better than the films and i thought the films were great,positive
make up your own mind and dont let others put you off,positive
i loved this show the only two things i didnt like,positive
this final episode does just what a previous comment says it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not dont we all wish we could do that this is what she did with the entire episode,positive
but i loved the movie mr and the setting was both near original and fun come on guys,positive
when i first watched this movie i thought it was a very strange movie so i decided to watch it one more time,positive
although the acting may not be superb the fight scenes are fantastic i hope you take the time to view this movie,positive
this show needs to come back ive seen every episode and this is real quality,positive
i enjoyed this film very much a really good movie,positive
without them i think it would be a mess but this time start where it left off an keep the same people in it,positive
for me still one of the best tv series ever,positive
it looked like it might be an interesting little short though so i turned it on,positive
plus i think most people would enjoy this watching it,positive
rent the dvd and then tell me im wrong cant can you thats because you know im right,positive
yes it is no matter what some people will say about it how much well pretty much he is such a brilliant director,positive
i got the dvd and watched it last night i thought ok cool one minute what the hell i still had another hour and a half to go,positive
so on the whole it is a first rate film,positive
the film is an under budget sci fi movie which actually works due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes this movie may not be for everyone though the film has crazy ideas,positive
it certainly gives films of this period a unique look,positive
all in all the man who knew too much is a fun film to watch,positive
overall it is quite a well done film that should do okay on dvd it is definitely worth a look,positive
i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also b s,positive
but everything else in the film seems cheap the worst thing in this movie is the reason youre watching it the sex,positive
i was really surprised with this movie i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap and i was very surprised,positive
i can say that it is the best film i have seen all year,positive
it has good acting lots of gore and a decent plot,positive
this is for the most part definitely not the case here s go figure and shes also my favorite part of the entire movie never do they use its ill or thats its always it is i will and that is now thats a good song,positive
i love this movie the other actors in this movie are great too,positive
this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece,positive
this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen home room is a beautiful film and thats all there is too it,positive
so if you watch this movie make sure its the original version,positive
and you know what and ive read the original book,positive
in some ways its a lot better and in other ways it is definitely not so which is the better film,positive
but i could live with that because of the films subject matter and because of a few other things you know what i told you all those things i just told you its people live in the dark see it if you have a chance,positive
i want to see them as soon as possible again,positive
b has mr and this isnt the first time shes done that b it still works well and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own,positive
my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie the actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing very funny i would love for this to come out on dvd,positive
at times i really wonder when i look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than i have ive just seen it and liked it not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film and no and while that doesnt work out perfectly at least i think it works quite good the opening scene is really special,positive
well i never cant we go doctor i dont like the look of this place i keep thinking were being watched dont be silly girl b what is more important is how good a script this is dr,positive
then too the script the direction and the production are very very nice,positive
what a crazy film hours and you dont understand who these people are and what are they doing,positive
this movie has it all a must see you will love it,positive
i doubt it but youll never know once you see this movie,positive
i was really disappointed to see that the original cut may have been lost and there is little chance of it being released on dvd a real classic,positive
i will always think of mr watch it then try to watch another version its just not the same is it,positive
he meets a show girl and falls in love you will enjoy this film even though the ending might not be a happy one i enjoyed it,positive
i was not disappointed by this movie the actors did a very good job in playing john and paul i also liked the dialogue between them which was basically what the entire movie was,positive
stupid stupid stupid she deserves better and so does everyone else in this movie talent is just wasted sorry but i dont feel like writing a review for this i give it no stars out of,positive
this film is well cast often silly and always funny,positive
it seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand the movie was deep it told a story and in doing so made you think if you like great acting writing lots of action and some of the best directing ever see this movie take a chance on it,positive
my friend knew someone who worked on it so i thought id check it out i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again the actors were really good and i loved all the music,positive
so as for the first the actors mostly for the story,positive
mr it is slow moving but stay with it she was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time,positive
forget about it this is what i was meant to do this is where i was to be,positive
the film is far from perfect it is probably too long,positive
i highly recommend this one especially for those who have an interest in acting as a must see there are several scenes of note,positive
i dont remember this film getting a cinema release over here thats why this film didnt do well always,positive
she is mean i didnt like her not even a little bit and i started to like her what a scene but parts of her are present in many women and men in my life,positive
the acting by all is excellent he doesnt seem to be acting,positive
it very excellent none the less absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene unfortunately it had a slow start or i could have recommend this film a little more highly even then it is still well worth a look,positive
there are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level,positive
this movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone was great,positive
this made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies,positive
man what a day that is the whole premise behind nothing theres nothing but white space,positive
its quite simple and doesnt seem as well thought out perhaps this movie didnt really took itself serious enough since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light,positive
we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us well enough about that this movie is very good not just good but very good is that not right,positive
it is very hard to tell you more without giving away the story and the plot but it is enough to say that this is a game you will not forget,positive
the only problem i have at the moment is where im going to see more of his films on the big screen,positive
mr mr mr then again what do i know im only a child,positive
a a why should things change says john if you need me ill be there,positive
at first youre not sure about these people or the film making style like the characters i need to see it again the music is amazing the film looks as good as anything shot on film,positive
this movie is funny in more ways than one its got action,positive
well after a kind of a slow start i was far from disappointed,positive
this shows us a reality of life see it i recommend it to all young people,positive
its so good its difficult to put into words one of the imdb reviews begins where was this film when i was a kid,positive
this is the reason why you go to the movies its got everything,positive
i would have to say it was worth the effort there is hope anyway what do i know not a bad effort,positive
its the little things that make this film work but after seeing the film its easy to understand why we care about him,positive
to me movies and acting is all about telling a story the sets were real enough and the atmosphere believable all in all i think this was one of the best movies of its kind i gave it a rating of ten,positive
it works in more ways than one might imagine truly he is coming into his own,positive
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen,positive
we liked the movie and the message and would recommend it for the entire family,positive
or did it and it was its old self again watch it,positive
if they didnt have those actors the film would have been lost and boring imdb,positive
what a brilliant film at a little over two and a half hours it is a very long film too overall a truly wonderful film,positive
really great movie i sure hope it comes out soon we all got to comment on the movie and a lot of people didnt seem to like it i really loved it and i dont know why so many people didnt think it was that good it really is worth seeing,positive
for anyone who has ever loved and lost you will understand for those who havent you wont,positive
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes excellent short film,positive
i they just did not as silly as one would imagine i i i i i,positive
everything obviously he does not want to let it happen i cannot say which is better that is totally up to you we can live only once you will get more from the movie,positive
their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself,positive
i liked mr the last series was boring and i only watched to see what happened in the end,positive
it was a time when family was the most important thing this film shows all of that and more what a movie,positive
this one however was nothing less then good the story is well written the story is good the characters are really good they are well written and believable this is a good looking movie the acting is really good as for the rest of the cast they are good too all together this makes out a pretty strong cast if i had known that when seeing it it would probably just be even more interesting its a movie i believe everyone can enjoy its kind of a feel good movie not bad at all,positive
ive watched many short films in my day this is perhaps my favorite short film ive ever seen i cant recommend it highly enough,positive
and i do like it it is a really beautiful film,positive
but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film,positive
this film is about so many things a very enjoyable film,positive
i had never seen this film before how is that for a twist,positive
the acting that mr just be sure to see it,positive
this is one of the best comedy ever if you dont laugh while seen this movie you dont have any sense of humor,positive
i dont get it i love love love love it always has it started out well black and white there it is i think it is just beautiful everything in it is just perfect anyway this is a great flick definitely check it out if you havent seen it one of my favorite horror films of all time,positive
this movie was so great i recommend it to everyone i really hope that they can work again together i have finally found movies that are good to watch but at the same time these movies arent cheesy,positive
i have to admit i had never heard of this movie still worth it it was that good,positive
really look at the little things yes yes but wasnt the first yes its a movie please dont expect this to be a sequel to part one its a great comedy of its own i think i will,positive
and oh no that makes it bad this movie is good fun im going to set you all on fire,positive
i wonder if its because of the part he played in the movie one by one the people get killed off she almost got out the first time,positive
i loved this movie so worth the long running time i need help with the ending though,positive
i dont understand the people who didnt like this movie it seems like they were expecting a serious,positive
etc but stop i dont want to tell you how it goes on and there are a few,positive
this isnt the case no surprise there i hope you enjoy the movie,positive
this series has it all no really she is this series has it all,positive
i really like this show give it a chance if you have never seen the show how could you not see something was there or take that long to see it i guess i should say happy viewing,positive
real love true love beautiful love sad love happy love silly love dumb love love love love of course when this man comes along i want to be that kind of man thats a kind of hero thats my kind of hero,positive
its got some very funny jokes in it and the animation is superb,positive
dont look up where the stars are now so watch and enjoy dont think just have fun,positive
i also enjoyed how mr the special effects that is all i can say,positive
theres just no getting around that and its hard to actually put ones feeling for this film into words its easy to think that such a love story as beautiful as any other ever told could happen to you,positive
her typical role is as a woman looking for love the storyline is also great a in the end though they find out the truth,positive
and i love it this is a very funny show in its own ways,positive
but i wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining,positive
but this movie is about so much more this movie is so good and so deep this is a movie about living,positive
but watching the movie you can almost for see what will happen,positive
make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie,positive
this little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine,positive
and youll have fun all the while you are doing it well worth a rent,positive
eventually they die the script is quite brilliant in fact i dont know if ive ever seen them used better well if that is true i just cannot wait to see another one,positive
its a family movie i think its thought out well and its entertaining to watch if youre looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you,positive
anyone who does not find this movie funny does not understand simple comedy,positive
try watching both of these films again with an eye to the whole picture,positive
its much better than the stuff he made us watch last year and the ending was absolutely fantastic thats one of the best moments in the film,positive
but it is a comedy so everything works out well,positive
in fact i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one i also enjoyed the plot as a whole ive probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film,positive
theres no place like home theres no place like home,positive
still i liked the actors for the most part lets hope for a good future,positive
ive loved it ever since she put up with so much for those boys i think shes such a strong character and her final scene when well you know best musical in my opinion of all time,positive
not this one though they even went to school sometimes hilarious together,positive
here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are the best thing about this film is the way it looks this film probably has more beautiful women in it than any other,positive
i think it was beautiful and i for one recommend it,positive
an excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything,positive
this is a pretty good documentary i should also add that the music in this film was pretty good too,positive
as written and directed by a if you havent seen the film maybe you should stop reading here under the excellent direction of mr,positive
her show wont change the world nor is it meant to the best kind of comedy around,positive
but a great cast and thats just the beginning even at that at the end you may wonder why you watched,positive
i havent watched the movie yet but cant wait to see it and the actor is really hot bring it on,positive
unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average with average acting by all actors said to her,positive
there really isnt much to the story its simple and it works well an easy film to just sit down and enjoy if you like horror watch this,positive
i thought the movie i do they dont was fantastic so many people have been talking about this movie all good,positive
but i have to say the it was a good dance film i think there should be more songs too but it was a good film as i said before,positive
copy for me excellent tv series never to be heard of again great,positive
i know its silly but i myself found it absolutely hilarious take this movie for what it is and enjoy it,positive
i know during the running time the ending i can only wish this was his final film because thats a perfect close if there ever was one,positive
i wish they would it was the best show ever i really would i miss it i think they should make another one and no one will read it,positive
despite this i decided to watch it thinking it would be some new show i could laugh at,positive
you should definitely see this movie if you can get your hands on it,positive
the plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well,positive
i watch the show every day and it is very entertaining,positive
i dont know that actor looking forward to watch the sequel,positive
this is a wonderful thriller i watched many times and never can get enough of,positive
whats wrong with that it doesnt have any big special effects but so what who needs special effects i think not well you know not all movies need special effects t plus theres some emotional points to the film shame on you all,positive
the acting is superb i highly recommend this film to anyone its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it,positive
it is as if i am living their lives feeling what they are feeling,positive
love it love it love it dont rent it buy it now,positive
i recommend anyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and mystery the movie is slow at times but in all it really interesting,positive
some people were looking for a plot its not a movie,positive
but there is so much more in this movie every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it,positive
you wont want to miss it if youve enjoyed what came before,positive
this one has a lot of them this movie was really good just too predictable and what horror movie doesnt have stupid people,positive
this can be enjoyed by anyone from any age and theyre not the only ones who may get into this,positive
its just fantastic to watch them they are both on the same level in many ways wait thats not true,positive
in my view the best movie ever made great stuff,positive
unfortunately he comes for her money not her love the story seems better when i look back on it but it is very slow and dull,positive
something like that she was fantastic in her role by the way,positive
i love this film its nice to see it again this time on dvd it never looked better,positive
expect more good things to come from this writer director actor,positive
by the way it looks at the other comments made it seems that a lot of people did not get the point to the flick,positive
that alone is a good reason to watch it if you havent done so yet you either will like it or you wont i myself think its a memorable film,positive
i shot this movie it was a great experience which shows up on the screen i feel like all of the actors gave excellent performances,positive
a bit of gore but nothing really that bad thats at best viewing,positive
this is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast i rate this as one of the best movie of the year,positive
but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense and the directing is wonderful the friends enjoyed it too,positive
anyway i knew i had to see the film again could i enjoy the film without his comments what he is doing what he is saying goes way beyond art,positive
true but we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place,positive
this film was hilarious theres no other way of saying this the performance was of course completely over the top but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well please because that film i need at home to watch several more times,positive
lost is the best tv series there is first of all it has great actors and wonderful directing i believe these people are wrong,positive
s director david s what the film does is get the job done the right way and i liked it,positive
any movie that has a line of dialogue that goes something like this has to be good,positive
i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time,positive
the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb and thats about all ill give away,positive
if you want to have a lot of fun a the theater however this is the one,positive
that is exactly what happens in this one it is a great family movie please see it if you have not already,positive
its hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become especially if like me you happen to like the tv show more its a place where men can be boys but i dont know you got things to say,positive
all the same hes trying his best to do what hes supposed to theres really not a whole lot more to say than that if you like you like it,positive
theres a lot of humor and some romance too rent or buy it now,positive
i love it it just makes me feel good thats all you need to know,positive
which classic tale you ask but that doesnt mean that this isnt a good film anyway at one level i was watching this and thinking oh my god this is so lame its not what happens its how the music is also great,positive
brother fighting fire with fire give this one a look,positive
its definitely a feel good movie but with a nice message to leave you with,positive
i dont care how predictable it is i laugh anyway you see exactly where it will go wrong and you will not disappointed,positive
this was a very good show the show was well written if you are able to find this show on dvd you should get it for your whole family,positive
its excellent script and a class cast make it a must see,positive
did you ever think they would make a movie about it well i knew they would but i didnt know when and now its here at last they were truly amazing just looks so good anyway the storyline fantastic,positive
say what you will about one dark night but it has it all so see at least once in your life or death,positive
for quite a long time in my life i either did not like this film or i liked this film but not as much as many more this is a film very much to be watched with other people enjoy,positive
my husband and i just got done watching this movie i was not expecting it to be this good but this one had me i loved it im going to have to watch it again before i take it back i might even have to buy it,positive
cinematography was excellent wonderful entertainment from beginning to end check it out,positive
the second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year,positive
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i dont remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i dont think ive seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show,positive
i didnt know it had been in a theater at all i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit old its out there might even be on dvd by now at least i hope it is,positive
how this all plays out in the end youll have to watch for yourself unless youve seen the film before of course again i recommend it mostly for those who havent seen it end,positive
and she looks great by the way if you cant experience her live yet please see this movie come on people give it up for the lady,positive
either way his performance is very well done all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay,positive
for once i did not guess the ending the relationship with the little brother is so close to real life have fun,positive
i cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie,positive
i felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional i never knew he could act so well the acting was absolutely superb by him,positive
what to say about a movie like rock star a lot actually oh well you will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that it is also the reason why i loved this movie so but it isnt a great movie the problem with rock star is the character development what is wrong with the character development is this there isnt any none but the problem is nothing ever does come made no sense and had no reality to it at all see it for fun see it for entertainment,positive
the movie is okay it has its moments the music scenes are the best of all the soundtrack is a true classic i highly recommend them,positive
why isnt this film more well known hope i can find it on video,positive
boy it is the best years of our lives there is not a single part in the film which could be left out this was real life it could not have been portrayed any different this my friends is how it was,positive
this is the first american film i have seen at this year and i think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling but attention everyone he is a kid how many people can understand him and i think people should learn to understand each other at another hand i like the music in the film very much,positive
this is not an a western not enough people and budget i expect to see the young actors in the film again in the future hope to see more,positive
this is how i feel about the show actors playing different roles in different episodes only in a tv show,positive
in real life he may very well have done so,positive
it is rather good but it could have used a bit more the first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in the problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough i think they needed a bit more back story for that one all in all though it was an interesting set of stories,positive
many of the earlier comments are right on the money but some well not so much,positive
some of the scenes are very funny watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it,positive
i saw this film many years ago on a old black and white t mr movie,positive
the soundtrack is so funny i laugh every time i hear it again so bad its good out of stars,positive
once you get over that you can really start to enjoy it very well made film,positive
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good so while it isnt a perfect movie its certainly an enjoyable one,positive
not many people have seen this film and it is a shame because it is a work of art,positive
actually like me at the moment where where and hes not dead either what could possibly be the thing he made or didnt make,positive
s then i found this dvd it was almost as good as being there paul is still the man and i will enjoy this for years to come also paul is not dead out of,positive
what on earth were they up to in the editing room there is no sound no dialogue,positive
this will be a different kind of review well i told you it would be a different kind of review,positive
if only i could go back to those days i love the characters im so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart its an amazing movie,positive
the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film nothing about the film seems forced,positive
i just wish that the story could be a happy ending,positive
but as i said not quite my own favorite of all their movies,positive
if youre reading this you probably know what i mean i guess you know what i mean by that too,positive
does this mean i have to get a life now,positive
there were some comments about the music i thought it was quite nice for the piece look how much money and people were behind that movie all in all i think it was very well done,positive
its the kind of a movie what i despite most,positive
when this movie came out it was a first you will love this film happy days this would be the perfect film to watch take it for what it is,positive
i love this movie remember it and the story was wonderful the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful,positive
ill give you the low down think about it brilliant wonder why,positive
i think this is one of the best movies of all time would love to know what others think as well the acting was just out done,positive
very good drama in season two if that would be the case then there should be a movie to complete it,positive
what a scene a new love can you love someone you cant love or think you cant love live live again,positive
how could we but there was a moment something with dance if they were in that film then we should have done something more something better but we clearly didnt know what now what,positive
again not a big deal oh i thought of something else that was strange,positive
it is not a movie for kids id like that,positive
after all these years i could finally see the film,positive
this film is not in black and white oh no,positive
i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie it was my first horror movie maybe thats the reason why i can still remember some parts of it but where do i find it,positive
and she is a very nice lady by the way,positive
if you like comedy you should watch this look look at this monster here for example wait a minute thats me,positive
you have to watch this to know what i mean,positive
movies not because its the greatest movie of all time but because it surprised me not only was it a t,positive
i thought she did a great job in this the supporting cast was pretty good too i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this,positive
and youre the one behind him its great art at least for this movie,positive
everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job what an ending just when i thought it couldnt give me more it did,positive
a movie everyone should both see and enjoy go see it,positive
and i for one think that is a good thing,positive
leading this bunch of guys is surprise so back to the main story and they were short but like i said earlier the beginning of the movie i found to be very funny when it was good it was good but when it wasnt good it got to be boring,positive
how wrong i was i am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not,positive
this one is obviously low budget but it is certainly well done,positive
i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie and enjoy,positive
that being said if you dont know the plot see the movie or better yet read the book in fact i think i might have been a little lost at this point in the movie at this point had i not read the book because of this,positive
i would like to say that no movie is going to be as good as the book thats just the way it is its the best tv ive seen in years,positive
not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously but it isnt that at all pretty place,positive
ive never done that with any other movie i think that those have to be my favorite parts of the movie,positive
a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming,positive
which i should do but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it but overall its worth watching,positive
and its actually pretty good in fact this movie has the same subject as the documentary,positive
oh and the death sequences are the best what was that all about,positive
dont take my word for it watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself,positive
well so i was really surprised about this one in my opinion it is one of his very best movies if it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be the best i liked the story the directing and the actors she will have a great movie career in the future the few action scenes were very well made,positive
i enjoyed the animation theres a lot going for it though david t plays two roles i really like him i think its a good movie,positive
i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game,positive
i think its one of the best british kids shows there is its a shame its ending because its very funny if a bit cheesy sometimes and has great characters,positive
easily the most romantic thing ive ever seen in my life a masterpiece,positive
this is just great film making what can you say about this movie check this one out,positive
t no big deal t no big deal t no big deal,positive
i cannot say that is long we can see how far we have come from such an era a well made movie definitely worth watching,positive
its overall pretty good if not a little over the top,positive
i love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it,positive
i first played this game at my friends house years ago the very next day i went out and got my own,positive
this is a very good movie dont miss this movie,positive
now this isnt to say that its a bad film it certainly isnt this is not true of all her films but this one certainly is,positive
this is a really good film and one that ive enjoyed watching several times from the start its so well written,positive
lets face it lots of bad movies are made all the time and no im not full of myself man these people are hilarious its okay theres something to live for,positive
you need to see to movie to know why shes there very well acted by all,positive
this movie will be a another great example that i will remember the characters are extremely believable i would definitely look out for this on dvd,positive
she was also pretty in a classic kind of way,positive
i enjoyed this film this was a highly entertaining film,positive
no wonder dr number one there is no other movie like it that keep you coming back to watch it again and again at least i have,positive
then the movie starts these things could happen to anyone she has even come out with good performances in awful movies,positive
this is film is probably one of the best ive seen so far they later find out that there wasnt much there and set off on their own ways,positive
this movie was very good not great but very good yes he played most of the parts he was good but i would like to see him play something different i did not even know who he was in this movie i never seen him play a bad part yet one time because i didnt know who he was but she is so good here i actually know people who act just like her there are women like that in most of our lives,positive
i doubt it because i dont remember it as such do i understand now,positive
this is an interesting movie havent seen the beyond what if i want to do it have i done it do i want to do it is it entertainment is it art is it horror for the others it may be too much,positive
once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters i doubt you wont like the show,positive
ok best scene simply put the film doesnt take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it,positive
good stuff if you like old horror movies this one is worth a watch,positive
i cant tell you what it is not for certain anyway,positive
im not even sure what to say about this film romantic love,positive
i love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do so by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it,positive
this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects good movie with a good message,positive
in his world children are to be seen not heard so why would mr like mr,positive
all three actors could save almost any script oh did i mention the sex,positive
perhaps theres something about past and future to think about here anyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you,positive
for me this movie was powerful ive been in a couple of them after all isnt that what its all about,positive
by far one of the best sci fi films out there,positive
i dont know what that means i dont even know if thats supposed to mean something,positive
is an excellent director i look forward to many more movies from him in the future,positive
overall i recommend this film to any sci fi fans you wont be disappointed,positive
i have no idea what the budget on this movie was but whatever it was they made it work this movie has everything but this movie has no black and white like crap classic this never happened but it could see this movie,positive
who knows so that his wife can keep looking beautiful what will happen a fun little view,positive
first of all let me say this film isnt for everyone it has a very strange subject matter i wont give away the rest of the plot if you can find this film watch it you cannot take your eyes off of it what makes it so interesting well it is totally unique you wont forget it soon,positive
youll have to see there are memorable characters lines and sets,positive
i dont understand how people could not like this movie its really a shame,positive
this really is a great movie the story was way cool if you havent seen it you definitely need to check it out on dvd if possible,positive
home room really surprised me i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone,positive
the entire production is as perfect as one could expect a masterpiece of cinematography,positive
great movie i loved it great editing and use of the soundtrack,positive
what a great movie this was hell or something in between definitely worth it,positive
all in all i thought the movie was pretty well done so if you havent seen it get it,positive
some people i silly what is a comedy supposed to be serious,positive
thats all it was meant to do and it does so if not then dont waste your time,positive
this is a really great film it gets you thinking about your parents definitely see this documentary,positive
even the acting was fairly decent the camera work was above average its just a good flick,positive
the story is as powerful now as it was the first time i saw it,positive
you might think there are too many characters but its probably too many scenes,positive
but really all the acting was fine i recommend this movie,positive
dr dr the movie is well done and the character of dr its a little sad somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama great movie,positive
each episode was a new story with new characters i have yet to show this to my own children but this is indeed a series that is more than family entertainment if you cant do that then just find it some how,positive
have an open mind and you will enjoy it he was great spent a lot of time with the fans hes sad very true to himself i knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so it actually takes a lot out of you to watch i will mention some of it here without trying to give a lot away wait it out though i think its a little bit of both i love his character you love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing nice job will,positive
why if youll like it or not thats a different story very personal one in the end i must tell you one important thing,positive
but the story is great great fun id watch it again with my daughter,positive
in all this is a great movie i recommend it,positive
its not the best movie ever but it was nice,positive
not cheap but well worth it to me this is a movie i will be watching until the end of my days,positive
and the ending now thats sad well i recommend this one for all you parents with small kids,positive
this is movie from which we all can learn something,positive
after such a movie you cant do another one in the same point of view,positive
this doesnt even feel like a movie you feel like youre there many scenes are obviously not just realistic they are real,positive
this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind well forget it but this movie doesnt let you go,positive
this film is actually scary no of course not and what an ending,positive
i absolutely loved that i like the end a lot,positive
all of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history,positive
dont mind the soundtrack which is played out by now,positive
i hope to one day see this movie on dvd,positive
i will try anyway the supporting cast is very well done this is where we see that there is hope for him,positive
he wants to run away with her she doesnt know if she can live without the things money can buy,positive
this is a very realistic movie the actors were great,positive
last thing ive got to say youve got to see it,positive
i thought this was one of the best movies ive seen in a very long time i always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best ive seen in a long time i look forward to another such movie and will keep my eye out,positive
i just watched this film and i have to say it surprised me the look and feel is a lot different from many movies and you can easily get into the film which is not here i did enjoy this film though it is worth watching,positive
this is by far my favorite film of all time,positive
this game is amazing really you should get it if you dont have it i believe that this game will always be a classic,positive
but i found this movie truly moving and it did it more than once,positive
this has got to be the best movie ive seen one of the few movies that i own,positive
i myself cant say i had a lot of fun watching it,positive
this movie is very good it is hard to find a problem about it i give this movie an a only because it is a little bit predictable,positive
it was only because there was nothing else on that i decided to watch it in the end i thought it was great,positive
i absolutely loved it he played his character very well i was not disappointed in the end do not wait for this movie to come out on video go see it enjoy,positive
i was five years old at the time this movie was pretty scary for a five year old,positive
im very surprised that so many people dont like this movie,positive
but still its often hard to read the original material after a film gives away the best parts i certainly enjoyed those on film as in the book,positive
the soundtrack is perfect i know i know she was still young not so what is there not to like,positive
i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy i loved it,positive
this is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch i say give it a chance because you just might like it,positive
there is nothing wrong with the film they dont make movies like this today yet it has fine humor as well the story is very interesting,positive
dr this movie is a movie of many classic scenes,positive
youll know what i mean after youve seen red eye overall red eye was a better than expected thriller that says a lot but thats pretty good,positive
overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture,positive
its funny how your life can change in a second,positive
and indeed he had it simply has never looked better,positive
this film is a perfect example of this very thought,positive
youve got to see it in the movie to understand it,positive
this is a brilliant film see the film and find out the rest,positive
then two things happen why not one is dead we dont know if enough of them can be found,positive
i was watching this movie at one of my usual time which is real real late at night by the end you feel like youve known him your whole life,positive
a happy to say it was better than that seems its taken years to find her end,positive
this film is about several things overall this film is one of the best ive ever seen,positive
if only it was that easy where does it end,positive
say that three times s only in world of film,positive
also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original also a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original,positive
i think there are so many good parts in this movie i cant name all of them,positive
truly one of the best movies i have ever watched,positive
oh come on learn to have a little fun one of the best movies i had seen now its a little stupid but come on only this one is actually funny like i said its just a good time its just a funny movie with some memorable characters thats all,positive
ive long been a fan of her work and this is no change the film also has a brilliant soundtrack,positive
to me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be but the way that ending came about was,positive
work with it for the first few minutes and you wont be disappointed,positive
unfortunately wrong its fun to see well known actors in almost every episode of the series,positive
just keep on going just keep going i guess this movie got me thinking even more about all of this so i guess it has done what it set out to do,positive
i love the series some things never change and we see the good old boys every day,positive
this viewer didnt see it coming excellent performances all around,positive
all in all this is an excellent movie if you have the chance i highly recommend that you view the movie,positive
this movie is a good one i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever i did find one thing weird only in america,positive
far better than in most other movies in this type of genre,positive
now i could just check the plot here on imdb but im pretty sure thats right just a great film great action great humor good acting wonderful film experience ive got to watch this again after all these years,positive
i myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end give the film a shot,positive
i just saw it and cant wait for it to come out on dvd,positive
there is no sex in it but sex is thought of including the idea that it may matter what others think about it,positive
i the other main actors are good as well she has so few lines,positive
thats the wonderful thing and very funny with it you will not be disappointed,positive
i know what most of people will think about this movie without even seen it and stuff like that and yes it is but you know what i loved it seriously its a very romantic film and even have a romance with him right i think the actors did a great job time will tell watch it,positive
in fact the story is pretty good the real story then things are about to get interesting again but fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway,positive
did i enjoy it im not sure enjoy is the right word did it make me think definitely im still thinking about it scary stuff,positive
you want to forget something but you never can it cant go away you see and,positive
amazing effects for a movie of this time watch it rate it tell us what you think,positive
if you want the book as written then read it i dont see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next at every stage,positive
oh how incredibly wrong i was there were many great moments in the movie right i know i did keep your kids out of this film they dont need to see this at least until they are older i know i will,positive
this is one to watch a few times great film setting story soundtrack and characters i hope to see more of these characters in other films sequel could be done theres a whole lot more of the world i would like to see through their eyes,positive
but this one is worth it so here they are so there it is definitely worth your money,positive
how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch,positive
i really dont care what people can say badly about this movie been trying to watch all things she makes and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played i love her looks even though people say shes not pretty i think she is and i love her eyes the movie is about many things well maybe is a little bit of all that heart and above all i hope you get to see it this is a good movie to see if your not well see it anyway,positive
id recommend to buy this movie on dvd because its a movie you might want to watch more often than just once,positive
but i think the first time you watch this movie you get to know the characters,positive
this is not a movie for them and enjoy the show,positive
there would be a sequel to this one but it was not quite as good as this one however the ending was a bit more final than it was here,positive
they must have liked children at one time you just cant imagine how,positive
i dont know how he does it this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet amazing and sad all at the same time you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie you cannot miss a thing well worth the money that you will pay to watch it dont wait for it to come on tv,positive
but i did something almost as good i did not watch it but the way we follow him he is not the two never meet we know this,positive
and especially this one why to watch it like you would watch a dream,positive
its an amazing movie just your average kids you really need to see it yourself,positive
although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other all in all a well done film,positive
not really during the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car during the last moments of the series the same car appears,positive
i had a great time would recommend it cannot wait for the dvd to come out s,positive
this is possibly the best short crime drama ive ever seen the other actors are of course great too which they usually are in british tv film,positive
it is amazing and i recommend it to anyone i loved it so much and now i want to know what happens next,positive
one feels after watching this that its really made of two movies,positive
and then probably only the third house in the street to have television,positive
usually how it goes with all movies im a horror movie fan its hard to keep up i really liked this one you telling me there is no effort in this one i knew what i was getting when i watched this movie,positive
the movie shows a lot of hope despite all the bad things that happen in their lives that theres always hope,positive
in the beginning credits they show it i think this is an amazing movie i watched this movie for the first time now i am a huge fan and im sure your child will be too,positive
its as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films ive seen all year,positive
when it comes to the story i dont see anything quite bad about it no matter this is a great film in its own right no its a great film period,positive
the movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it i have to say it is not for the american viewers the cut was different and much better see it and you will like it or maybe hate it it is long and too hard to keep up with but by the second viewing it makes more sense,positive
sure maybe i didnt understand it when i was that young but i still enjoyed it and now that i have been able to understand it for several years i love it even more and she should she has been playing this part for several years everyone is perfect,positive
but it is dumb in a good way it is funny dumb,positive
i think if anyone shows it to their child they will come up with the same result they will just love it,positive
worth the watch maybe a few times perfectly which makes a great movie for me,positive
and michael is on my list now i cant wait to see the rest now i enjoy watching tv again,positive
what can i say about a tale such as this the story line was wonderful,positive
these guys just have it a but not in this film,positive
since this movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well off it was just scary as to how real it really was her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen yet it was done so well,positive
the movie itself is great and the acting is extremely well done,positive
there isnt a bad performance in the film the funny parts are funny,positive
ive seen this story before but my kids havent but it still works,positive
the director did excellent work there is great camera and the actors are really great i like war movies so i really liked this one,positive
but then i got to thinking in short too late see it with an open mind and it might just open your mind,positive
id like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they like see this movie,positive
since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didnt matter to me,positive
i think it had it all but like i said this movie had it all almost in my opinion,positive
this is not to say that there is no action in the movie,positive
look out for classic film fans this is almost a must with this cast and good story,positive
sad isnt it he knows how to make a movie i hope he has more coming,positive
this isnt a bad thing though i hope a dvd release is in the future,positive
right now would you want to sit there and watch it again,positive
and it shows in this film but in a good way,positive
i dont know how you can like this show i think that if it didnt have those laughs i dont know how you call that in english sorry you wouldnt laugh at all sorry for my poor english again,positive
i mean this movie is truly funny see any of his films if you can,positive
i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film,positive
the plot is simple the end couldnt have been better it is the best comedy of the year hands down,positive
i just wanted to check it out i was not expecting much of anything right wrong at times the acting seems a little over the top its worth seeing more than once i completely recommend this movie,positive
ever made at least i believe it has thats it that is the way it happened guys,positive
that makes sense i seem him more as a mr,positive
this movie is for all people who like a funny movie,positive
i can not believe how deep i am in this show,positive
this is a movie that gets better each time i see it mr,positive
this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed i always want to go back and read the book again,positive
seriously that movie so good what is our world coming to,positive
and every time the ending scenes still get me it is indeed my all time favorite movie,positive
if you are a movie fan in general you must see this it is its own genre i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again in reality there is no point at which this film could fairly be called boring,positive
at least for me its a perfect dance well everything you want it to a movie one will want to see again maybe not right away maybe after a few days years but its something to go or come back to,positive
i always knew the day was coming we all knew,positive
but i cant believe that is mr and there is a new face in the movie,positive
okay its pretty cheesy at times but you know what all in all its actually a decent horror film,positive
so what was the point of this im not sure that they made it clear no other reason than that,positive
i truly am a fan this is what i believe happened here,positive
this is a great movie to watch with a good friend boy girl friend or family i watched the movie for the first time last night and now i want to own it,positive
you may be thinking to yourself well if its so great why havent i heard of it okay youre saying it has a good message two actually its not just the message that makes this movie special,positive
some of the other acting was good some was so so but none of it was bad ridiculous and funny,positive
its great that i am not alone and that there are people out there who liked it too,positive
the script the acting the screenplay i did not see that coming at all,positive
but it is funny as all get out can you ever really please them,positive
a lot of people say the end did not make sense but it did so that is a problem it was also a beautiful love story so what,positive
the cast is another strong feature of this film out of,positive
the movie is anything but original and really its not a good movie that out of the way its still a lot of fun so why,positive
hes free now but we still dont know the truth what ever that may be hes still a very fine actor great job by each of them there is much to remember from this film,positive
the events of the film are based on a true story,positive
when i first saw this show i thought it looked interesting,positive
but this is not hollywood you have to know that going in life is what happens to you do that,positive
although i can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie i still found it to be absolutely amazing it is beautiful and the acting is brilliant and thats exactly what this movie does give it a chance,positive
first real movie in this year i think also that the end was brilliant,positive
saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it,positive
each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true,positive
the background music of the film also plays a very good role it is just too good other actors did their job well,positive
this is one of those films when a movie makes me feel like that i know its really good see this film,positive
this movie isnt for a person without a good sense of humor or like i said you have a good sense of humor maybe this isnt a movie for you,positive
the most interesting thing about this episode i think a must see for all fans,positive
also i think the ending of the movie is perfect the performances are brilliant his performance in here is great we need more movies like this,positive
so i got a decent job and did what i felt i needed to do to make that happen,positive
i would never miss a chance to see this old art house classic again,positive
sure but it is very much worth seeing as it is,positive
and especially this movie does the job pretty well dont miss this one,positive
the screenplay the music and anything else is excellent in this film this is an excellent masterpiece in film see it,positive
i first saw this movie in the theater i just watched it a second time and i must say it was amazing it is a great story and told extremely well money that was classic if you havent seen this movie since it came out i say see it again,positive
was it a comedy a drama again a comedy or drama,positive
this film is great you will want to see it again and again very very funny you wouldnt want to miss out on it,positive
at least hes trying to act he needed more screen time,positive
the scenes in the back really got to my heart in future i will watch more of her movies,positive
jokes even mr of course any time mr in fact mr,positive
the characters come to life the rest of the cast has done a good job too,positive
he does the best he can to see that happen,positive
a true comedy if you havent seen this movie please give a look,positive
we certainly do in this fine film awful for the dead old man but funny,positive
she brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me,positive
parts are predictable but other parts are not like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are,positive
i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie,positive
its very very funny you know just like a comedy is supposed to be so what more do you want this movie is all you need to understand why shes a star those eyes great the eyes have it got that,positive
to get his own life get a job and get out of the house,positive
okay so its not that scary but it sure is fun okay ill stop,positive
what do i mean is it believable i dont know it will make a man out of him where does this end in fact it may never end i think this is an excellent film,positive
this is an amazing film to watch or show young people in fact other than a few good scenes this character seems pretty much wasted,positive
there were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch,positive
how these came to be and came to be in american hands is the story of this film,positive
this is a great film good work to the team,positive
this is something i have become quite used to havent we all believe me if you are a man you miss so many of the jokes in this film there is so much here that only a girl can understand im all with the use of too much blood but that is taking it a little too far the end of this move simply could not have been better,positive
their is no doubt about that which even had its own theme song despite being quite old now in video game years such a great cast and well written storyline the story comes to life on the screen almost as if the actors were their in front of you and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself,positive
the rest of the supporting cast did its job well,positive
the only problem is that when they come back they are not the same person theyre evil there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie it is almost perfect this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time,positive
i just wanted to say i liked this movie a lot but i also want to ask about something,positive
there are a lot of great things to the film for a start the acting its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work,positive
if i ever write movies or make them i would want one of them to be like this one this movie does stupid things without looking like it this movie is a time less classic,positive
such is life things come and go and you do the best you can excellent drama,positive
after having seen it you feel almost nothing if thats good or bad is up to you,positive
i found the film to be quite creepy the acting isnt too good nor is the dialogue at least in the early scenes in short this was a good film not the greatest horror film ive ever seen but it is certainly a lot of fun,positive
i have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind a must see,positive
i was told too late i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay,positive
but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid what more can you say about a film like this,positive
very nice work there were at times too little drama where more would have been expected,positive
but i believe its now here to stay totally work the watch,positive
if you havent seen the film perhaps you should stop reading here but is he really there at all mr,positive
however as this was a musical a beautiful voice came well through and she did a nice piece of acting as well,positive
no doubt however there will be more to come in the near future,positive
over all i think everyone did a superb acting job including all the children in who will love my children yes it is a sad movie as true stories can be but well worth the time,positive
ok finally a horror film thats done well i thought he was excellent in that role a great actor really made the role his own in this movie,positive
one of them set it up at the old high school they begin looking for a way out i for one dont the ending there is a twist the only way they are similar is that there is a twist which kind of left me disappointed then right after the twist comes a great if not the best kill in the movie after the last kill the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy and it was the perfect way to end the movie,positive
it is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film and perhaps there are too many characters,positive
i liked this movie its a good movie i just hope it will be on again or comes out on video,positive
it would be cool and entertaining but the experience would be lost,positive
its completely ridiculous clearly those of you who say that this is one of the best action movies havent seen many in your life,positive
where do i begin he can act and i must mention the music see this film and i mean now,positive
it starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious,positive
i watched it with my parents a brother and a few friends why its never been released on video is a mystery to me id buy it in a second if they ever release it to dvd,positive
the only thing she couldnt do was to not make a success of it this film is a perfect example the viewer gets to believe in what he is seeing and to care for it,positive
i remember this movie well and thought it was great the story seems like something john would do even in real life but there is something that i will always remember most about the movie well so as it turns out,positive
then a funny thing happened about the second time around he didnt have the money to make it look good but he did it anyway it also shows he was making the movie for his self,positive
its hard to say what it would be like on video,positive
one of the best film i ever saw hes such a good actor that you cant think of anyone else to take his part,positive
it isnt clear whether or not hes the killer since he seems surprised to see the body,positive
the movie is well written and the acting seems like real life by the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again this would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play,positive
ive read a number of reviews on this film and i have to say what is wrong with you people this was an excellent film the story made perfect sense to me and as i said was very well told all the actors did a fantastic job watch his eyes in his scenes just superb not a bad place to start excellent cast in this film this is a great film and should be seen i hope that you will see the film and i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do,positive
after she meets him again she begins to follow them around,positive
did you ever wonder how far one movie could go,positive
who really knows interesting and unique good job all good,positive
i dont think this movie is for everyone i thought the entire cast did a great job not me the movie was a real surprise i cannot wait to see it again funny funny funny funny,positive
god that gets to me every time this is a great movie watch it its good its great its funny and its based on a famous story worth your while believe me,positive
or at least you feel pretty high after this movie,positive
you should definitely take a chance and rent this one,positive
i have never seen him in anything not worth while i enjoyed the story i really liked this movie a lot,positive
despite the fact that ive never seen every episode i still enjoy it its hard to say which one is my favorite also i really love the theme song,positive
loved the story of a guy that tries to get his girl back like i said great film,positive
i must say i was surprised with the quality of the movie it was far better than i expected the director made a good job as well,positive
more people should watch this important and very fine film,positive
i was right the film is going to be a huge hit because of the three main stars they are happy again what happens next it was still excellent the songs of the film are great,positive
its the sort of film hollywood really wants to make but just cant,positive
its a good question i found it fun to watch,positive
this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie,positive
now hes on his own he and his wife make a great team she also did good job editing the film together they did a great job a new one on me check it out,positive
not any more cop show you know what theres nothing wrong with that,positive
it actually has a story and it is very romantic indeed it is simply how it is done in her world classic drama more sex,positive
if you get the chance take the time to watch it,positive
i started watching many t acting nothing short of superb the story is nothing short of excellent,positive
with this movie its all about style atmosphere and acting,positive
its one of the best movies that i have seen this year,positive
it will be interesting to see how this plays out,positive
nearly everything about the movie was great the acting was great,positive
it didnt work out well i guess someone had to end it,positive
love it love it love it dont rent it buy it now,positive
but let me tell you one thing but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie watch the movie to know each and every scene is so funny that scene is so funny,positive
i saw that when i was little and it was excellent this show is excellent the kids will like this show new words songs and watching them playing,positive
this movie is the first time movie experience for several people in the cast but they all did a good job,positive
the acting is superb it is my favorite movie of all time,positive
but it all works but this is comedy or the one that gets away,positive
it is basically a behind the scenes of the show its a fairly funny documentary,positive
one word for it hilarious i havent watched at movie like this in a long time he really in my opinion made the movie just a bit more hilarious,positive
like our man we dont get a chance to stop and wonder and why are there no children is the story even set in the real world,positive
the idea of the movie is simple doctor has new idea complete funny never a point of scary,positive
its certainly not entertainment at least not the hollywood kind so if your going to check it out i recommend you set yourself up for it,positive
the rest is history the show got better with each episode very interesting story line i highly recommend it,positive
what would my personal horror be that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you the horror you create in your own mind,positive
i had to see this is there a god how far would you go to right a wrong and what is right anyway im still thinking,positive
somehow i didnt find him very believable overall i would highly recommend this,positive
hes stupid enough to fall for it it was so funny a i cant get enough of it,positive
but i have to admit this film really surprised me,positive
writing about something so wonderful is completely hard three are the main characters watch it close your eyes in the credits and feel everything feel yourself feel the wonderful song,positive
now my wish has finally come true see this documentary tell your friends,positive
i loved how the game was played right to the last second and then beyond,positive
this is a funny and a great movie but good old time laughs if you want to see a movie see this one youll love it it has a wonderful cast and crew oh,positive
this is a strange strange movie its not perfect but what the hell,positive
they talk and fall in love thats it thats the movie,positive
i was expecting the worst when i started watching this well first off its not a horror film,positive
what fun it was but thats what you find out when you see this movie,positive
for the first half hour of the movie i thought i was going to love it still ill come back to that later,positive
thats fantastic i really liked about that part of the movie remember,positive
what could be better than that he wasnt always a nice man,positive
maybe that is how its supposed to be this is a horror film,positive
oh well you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea,positive
i did enjoy the movie but was probably expecting too much,positive
like most things that are funny in life there is always the sad side and there are some moving moments in this movie very enjoyable movie and well worth watching,positive
how wrong was i because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boring,positive
sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works very hit and miss no one can really act in the film,positive
it was amazing and truly worth watching but however this show is truly the best of the best,positive
while i rather enjoyed this movie ill tell you right now that my mother wouldnt its out there,positive
you name it she was all those things and more what love,positive
of course the original is better but this isnt as bad as everyone says the stories were not so bad either,positive
when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with she has never ever done anything better,positive
the movie was better than what i expected better music would have top this film it was more realistic than blood in blood out and in my history thats how it was,positive
where to start how i wish they did if you havent seen it please do you wont be disappointed,positive
this movie was simply amazing the cast in this film is perfect each character made the story more complete this movie is one of the best all year maybe even the best,positive
i think its definitely worth watching i would definitely recommend watching this movie,positive
i would definitely recommend this show to all young kids,positive
everyone is well cast of the three i probably liked this one the least but i still thought it was well done,positive
all the others are perfect for their parts as well,positive
this flick is strange but i liked it a lot but different than other movies in a good way i think but has lots of funny stuff too but the rest is way different nothing like that,positive
thats exactly how it goes most of them even if not all its not a waste of your time go and watch it,positive
so i decided not to see it i decided to do it and i found that he was right,positive
the script is good the best thing about the movie though is the direction the cinematography is some of the best ive ever seen,positive
the direction is good rest of the cast are fine overall well worth the watch,positive
i dont know what to say sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost,positive
the movie is worth seeing at least once there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there enjoy,positive
a film to live with simple yet deep you will want to watch it again and again,positive
its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do when i watched this i thought why do they have to do all of those things anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one,positive
when i came back home i went to see it again they made mr so its not perfect though give mystery men a chance,positive
this was different thats for sure just look at the cast its silly but you know that going on,positive
they are all about the same thing blood and violence its not even creepy thats ok,positive
having never heard of following before i had no idea what i was to expect,positive
i really enjoyed this movie but thats just what he is about to do talk about getting even big time lots of action in this movie theres more to the story than this but ill just recommend you watch the movie,positive
it seems that this is the classic either love it or hate it movie the acting is great i can see why some may say the acting was horrible but thats what made this movie so great,positive
how far would you really go for your best friend this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend,positive
i hope all who see this somewhat older film enjoy it as much as my mother and i did a great film for all the family too see we need to have more films like this come out of hollywood,positive
a way better idea is simply for you to go see it,positive
if you havent seen this yet you really should on dvd i cant believe how much i enjoyed it for the most part the effects are excellent in any case you should definitely see this production for what it is its an a,positive
i really liked it the second time i loved it the third time the old man character is fantastic,positive
see this movie if you have not seen it already,positive
it is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half i was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be i couldnt take my eyes off of it and i had to ask myself why,positive
there are other ways that they could have shown this the acting is excellent,positive
but this isnt a romantic comedy mr and that says something well done,positive
but the story itself is not so much but i liked it anyway,positive
this wasnt everyone i know loved it they should do,positive
i do not really know why this movie was made what is the message of this story,positive
this movie is actually funny the rest of the cast is funny too especially the supporting cast,positive
because i watched it and i found it hilarious and where do they look for it youve never seen a film like that,positive
it was the hit of our home movies time mr remember him,positive
the days when you or our friend acted like the characters,positive
this is one of my favorite horror films of all time and i used to think it never really got its due it seems many feel the same as i did when i first saw it it was memorable,positive
anyway you must know how it goes from here whats the problem then end credits,positive
nothing has happened between them they finally meet in the dramatic and very brilliant end that brings them together he told her his life he can be happy with the woman the man and the woman finally meet,positive
im surprised i could have gone without it its too good to be true,positive
simply put its not for everyone for those of you who can do that i highly recommend it,positive
but what about war it was not so awful since it was so beautiful,positive
script cinematography direction and acting in a class on their own never shown on tv,positive
in the long run it probably could have done without,positive
when this film gets it right it really gets it right and when it goes wrong its everything that has to do with the romance just like everything else in this movie the acting is either perfect or terrible again one of his best roles now for the bad he does have the perfect voice for the character if you dont like that type of thing then dont expect this one to be different,positive
i really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it oh would i love to see it again too,positive
the atmosphere is right there and isnt that what a horror film is supposed to do there are plenty of creepy scenes in this movie,positive
this movie turned out to be better than i had expected it to be some parts were pretty funny it was nice to have a movie with a new plot,positive
watched this french horror film last night and pretty much liked it this movie does just that despite taking a while to get going,positive
not sure what else to say about it but i love this movie,positive
its a hell of a lot of fun i really enjoyed it,positive
not a country ive ever given much thought to i have to admit s a,positive
and in my opinion a much more human and emotional version and in my opinion one of the best movies ever made,positive
i am absolutely sure that this film is great enjoy,positive
most of the acting is horrible and way over the top but thats exactly what i expect in a movie like this the amazing thing about this movie is that there was obviously some money that went into it films like this made today just dont have the same style,positive
what do i particularly like about this film so what is there not to like,positive
oh my god i believe she is the greatest of all time,positive
i dont think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out it was a really great movie and a great mystery i definitely recommend watching it,positive
how much could the general hollywood director learn from this movie all it is the best of its kind,positive
well this is about as good as they come youre dead theres nothing really creepy about it his new girl friend is just dull i know i know,positive
you might not like what you will see but you wont soon forget it,positive
but that suspense is very good thats why i give it a pretty good rating the movie gets you involved in it,positive
this is one of the most brilliant french films ever made for ten years he has not made another film and this was his only one more more more,positive
the voice acting is good as with most animation movies,positive
loved the film one of those movies that should become a classic for all,positive
twist after twist is what the ending is all about and like most films it is a true hit miss situation,positive
of course i was only five at the time it came out you might be surprised,positive
it just never gets old it has it all it may not be my or your life it is not only believable it happens every day,positive
good script good director good cast there should be more films like this,positive
they cannot have watched the same series that i did,positive
this movie is just so good the plot is great as well its all very real which is scary go check it out,positive
i watched it many times in the years after and still do when it is shown on tv since seeing the thing i think i have seen most of his movies i havent gone out of my to do so but if one comes up just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it,positive
i did not know much about this movie before i watched it and i wasnt expecting much but i found the movie to be fun and entertaining im not sure what the budget for this movie was but i sense that if it was a little more then they might have really been able to hit home the gore and effects,positive
what i like about you is definitely a show that i couldnt wait to see each day shes a very funny person and seems to be down to earth but thats what made the show so great,positive
i never saw in my whole life a film like this one and it didnt looked like that movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see,positive
there have been many people who do not think that the things that are shown in the movie really happen in this day and age but the sorry and sad thing is they do the acting and the music is excellent,positive
they all give stand out performances in one way or another but thats good in my opinion,positive
if you enjoy suspense this movie has it i thought the cinematography was excellent i would call it overall good entertainment,positive
several times i hope you come away from this movie feeling as good as i did,positive
i love his voice yet theres nothing annoying about him,positive
not quite at least you figure hes happy sort of i cannot recommend this movie enough,positive
but find out they still hate each other i somewhat liked it so this is good just good not great,positive
brilliant cinematography the low budget really shows at times its not a masterpiece by any means but its a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class,positive
the special effects are obviously low budget but not too bad,positive
its definitely totally different than anything thats out there there is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together,positive
this film is a very beautiful and slow film there is nothing hollywood about it it is a story about love and life the two actors playing the main characters are great they really make them seem real very well done,positive
i was watching it it was on a black and white tv and not really a good picture but it got me interested,positive
this movie is great to make fun of rent it for a good laugh but he doesnt tell them the truth about who lives there just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look,positive
all in all this is a great movie out of,positive
if it had been realistic there certainly wouldnt have been much comedy i liked it loved it actually,positive
i absolutely loved this movie the cinematography was also very good wish i could have seen it on the big screen,positive
this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen its unique and an overall great movie,positive
you will never forget this film ever i what a film,positive
this animation tv series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works,positive
i had to get this movie since it didnt come to where i live i only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it rent this movie,positive
this show is wonderful it has some of the best writing i ever seen a perfect show,positive
but i was surprised to find it entertaining interesting and funny its an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film the acting on the whole is very good way better than a typical low budget horror film,positive
but i just dont get into it like a lot of other people do,positive
s so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldnt let the world know we were the good guys again,positive
even though it didnt work out how you wanted with the original film you have a fantastic piece of work and great viewing that goes for everyone else too loved it well worth a view great piece looking forward to seeing the next work,positive
i was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family,positive
it may never be filmed again with such a great cast again,positive
i saw this film for the first time last night i cannot say that it was my favorite film at least not yet i need to see it again i need to see the movie again maybe that is the whole point of it,positive
well im going to stop writing i know a write a lot sometimes but kids do have a lot in there head that need to get out and if they dont kids will never get to learn,positive
period and for a guy from his background to say that was one of the most,positive
watch laugh and enjoy this as their last great performance,positive
this film gets off to a bad start but then things take a turn by the time night falls it is great and even the character development of most main characters is well done,positive
why the atmosphere the story the actors actress are all brilliant,positive
this movie was on british tv last night and is wonderful strong women great music most of the time and just makes you think getting near to my best movie ever,positive
shes the man indeed one of those movies you cant miss out in your life,positive
saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene only wish i could find it again would certainly buy view it if i could,positive
its got it all and then some except a home this fantastic series its seem has it all except and ending if all goes well we will get our ending,positive
is there another time when this will be shown on tv if so please tell me when so i need to find a way for her to be able to watch this film please help me,positive
i have no idea why this documentary works the up series are about people and the change is great its horrible,positive
a s ridiculous it may be but i found it to be fun as well,positive
she is just so fantastic that i can watch anything she is in you have to check this out,positive
i said to myself its been a long time since i watched this movie so why not,positive
whats not to like about this movie what is the good of having money like that if you cant do fun things with it only if it was a fun and funny movie,positive
true crime feels very true or real to me i have not seen any other movie quite like true crime,positive
this film has its good and not so good points its a great part and his performance is perfect while some of the direction of the other actors isnt as good this was definitely a case of no small parts only small actors,positive
i have read the book and seen the classic movie many times it is far from it although it is interesting with the new characters and so on,positive
but i love this show so much much better than anything on tv today,positive
i saw this movie many years ago and it has never left my list of all time best films ever made up until the very end he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is,positive
in fact its quite entertaining b the cinematography quite on the mark much more entertaining than star,positive
i watched this movie for the message great message though should be more of them,positive
it doesnt matter did i mention its scary as hell like much of his work it may not be great art but it sure does tell a scary story and does it well especially once you realize whose head it used to be,positive
im not sure what version of the film i saw but it was very entertaining it has really nothing to do with the plot but its still entertaining,positive
how whats going on oh my god but i dont think we thought about what they were really going though no one expected this to happen why,positive
no no not at all so whats so special this movie is a must see for everyone,positive
i definitely recommend this movie the writing is good and the cast is great,positive
i loved this movie sure it is a bit on the low budget side but they did a great job with the budget they had i thought this film was brilliant,positive
the acting and the story were both well done and well directed,positive
however this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all something i always enjoy,positive
that was funny a lot of fun and fun for the whole family as well,positive
at least in the beginning the dialogue here isnt as fun as it should be whats more strange is that other than this the film doesnt look or feel like a play that doesnt mean the movie is bad it isnt its often extremely entertaining we see the ending coming and then we didnt see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didnt see coming but maybe you did,positive
well for western viewers anyway both of them films were kind of similar to each other but at the same time completely different i really enjoyed watching this movie and i hope you all enjoy this movie as well,positive
and above all the shot is a beautiful shot what a moment,positive
almost too well done because it would had slow down the action im not sure about that,positive
sometimes you have to look back to go forward we need to remember the past the past is part of the future i see a great future,positive
this is an important movie i would pay good money never ever to see it again,positive
this movie is really good fighting scenes are very good,positive
which is too bad because i really wanted to like this movie bad guys and there is good acting here i wish i could like this more but no,positive
a new york will always be the place for this best season ever in fact the british version is way better and that says something since the american and original truly is a great show,positive
and the last shot of the film is perfect i highly recommend this film,positive
to say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all writing is superb,positive
but i have my opinion for this movie you just watch it movie is really great,positive
and i dont exactly mean that in a good way this movie is so bad its actually good,positive
and hes going to have to do it very soon,positive
even though this movie is quite old no matter how many times i watch it it still makes me laugh,positive
this is not a love song it is a love song,positive
is it the strong the beautiful perhaps the person we just all seem to like,positive
what more can you say then a work of art,positive
its funny s i hope just a lot of fun,positive
note that i did not say that it is better just more enjoyable if i were an actor i would not have been able to keep a straight face at this point all in all a fun film theres not really even that much blood,positive
simply put youll never look at a zombie movie in the same way again,positive
this is by far one of the better made movies and didnt leave me disappointed at all as for mr,positive
i was expecting a good movie and i saw an excellent one it did not leave me after i left the theater rent it i cant recommend it enough,positive
i wasnt quite sure how a director can create nothing but leave it to mr to create another low budget set that looks real as real as nothing can be,positive
by the end of this movie i felt as if i knew her character better than i knew myself she did a simply amazing job in fact shes much better i loved this movie,positive
what makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different you probably already know what happens by reading the reviews but its pretty obvious from the start at the time and even now it was definitely not a typical movie quite art house on a personal level i must say i quite liked the film,positive
this movie gets right to the point you may be thinking what point,positive
and i dont say it in a bad way and i liked it that way,positive
great group of actors have only seen once since then and that was some time ago,positive
first off i absolutely loved this movie i thought it was excellent and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone,positive
an absolutely brilliant show one that made me think and think again,positive
this is one horror movie based tv show that gets it right but oh well,positive
its a unique performance i like the other two actors a great deal too,positive
and i loved it the movie has its serious moments what i really loved about this movie is how it ends great movie,positive
what they were the end was not quite important after all movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it,positive
i believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone just see this film to watch an amazing young actor i question why that didnt happen,positive
that being said it appears i may have been the only one watching,positive
great cinematography a good sense of humor no way no how,positive
loved it in my opinion a must see there is not a boring moment in the whole picture as i said earlier i think this movie was excellent,positive
as a man id say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it,positive
so worth your time watch it you wont be sorry,positive
the screen play mr based on the strong cast we decided to take a look the english actors are good what a beautiful voice she has,positive
somehow it doesnt make the movie any less great to watch though a great movie that could had been brilliant,positive
i have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie i was basically lost,positive
ill keep this one quite short hope that it isnt too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives is it right no its very nearly perfect in my view,positive
b overall if you like low budget horror films give this one a look,positive
youre wrong mr probably the first and last time on the screen i recommend this film and now own the dvd,positive
if you like plot turns this is your movie nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will not a slow minute in this film,positive
there is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic,positive
mr during the stay mr mr i have truly enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it,positive
in my opinion the best movie ever i love when people ask me what this film is about,positive
there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool this one is a classic dont miss it,positive
this isnt a deep film by any means great stuff at least i hope not,positive
and what do you know i actually liked it if you just want a good time you should check this out,positive
until two hours of write this and im not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece well if there any,positive
it was a great experience and i loved every minute of it i still act and do some tv but not as much i thought the acting was really good but the story line was only so so,positive
why and in this film i did i cannot say it was a great film and the film was too long overall he did okay okay acting an actor has to make you believe he is the character he is playing sometimes yes sometimes no but then again maybe not i wont particularly feel that he had been this was a decent film with decent performances and a decent story no,positive
this is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever which i believe makes the movie from good to great i mean movies today dont bring reality to kids and in this movie they did,positive
great stuff this is great entertainment which is the name of the game,positive
the world is a terrible place and if you dont like it you dont get it and if you dont get it doesnt matter its up to you if you want to play along every actor in this one had fun its only a joke and thats good enough for me the best version ever okay its no masterpiece but its not bad,positive
since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite this is an action movie at its best i dont think ill see another that is so entertaining,positive
some were not action that is i hope you pay attention to the storyline for it actually makes sense and works well with the whole,positive
the first time i saw this i didnt laugh too much,positive
and im looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also,positive
still it is a good movie she doesnt know a thing,positive
she is wonderful is every part that she plays i have been there they just went too young perhaps it is sad but that is how life is at times if you want to see good acting and the reality of life do not miss this movie,positive
this movie is a should be classic its not perfect certainly that is how this picture is to be enjoyed,positive
the same cannot however be said for the rest of the film,positive
the story is extremely unique the ending could have been fantastic i actually found it to be somewhat decent overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic,positive
the best years of our lives was probably the best example very well done,positive
add them all up and you get the best comedy youve never heard of okay b plus some truly classic lines and a fun twist at the end these are low life bad guys,positive
and im beginning to believe that he can act as anything anything human yes its predictable no simply he has a lot of screen time here a must see,positive
you dont realize as youre watching that you only know half the story until close to the end not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either,positive
this is not a bad film it has a few funny moments her performance alone is worth the watch,positive
you didnt expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece did you but whos to say it cant happen thats not my style,positive
the second viewing was much better than the first the box is so cool and the music is very good now i said before its like a video game the acting is really terrible,positive
some of the original songs were there but they were just background music a a overall this is a pretty good movie id recommend it for fans of the original,positive
but on with the review guess what happens to her then,positive
the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget,positive
it would have been boring if it was wouldnt it,positive
when they get it right they really get it right,positive
the whole score was terrible every time one of the lame songs came on i was turned off i liked the art and animation except for some things here and there,positive
big time they talk about what life is all about i wont tell you s,positive
this is a really strange film and that is not a bad thing im sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange but i loved it,positive
yes i know that this movie is meant as a comedy and the humor is over the top well we can laugh about it am i taking this movie too seriously yes of course to each his own fun,positive
i hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it,positive
i loved it and want my kids to see it,positive
so he called upon god one night about this but wait my work was good,positive
while far from perfect its also far from being the worst of the series,positive
this was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention through to the very end,positive
i would highly recommend this movie but first go and see it in the cinema if you can there is nothing quite like the cinema experience of a cinema made movie and the acting and the actors and the direction well watch out richard,positive
getting into all the characters here could take quite a while but this is one of the best movies ive seen in a while,positive
there should be more scenes of what they do to people so go rent or buy this movie right now,positive
at night but this is no dream s its that setting that does it at night,positive
she wanted to leave him but he just wouldnt let her go so easily if you have not read the book it is well worth it he was brilliant then and now he does an above average job with an amazing story,positive
it was better than i expected this makes for an interesting view,positive
today we call them home movies and they are just as boring now as this one is,positive
although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch although after watching other movies i know better,positive
one of the best films i have seen in a long time the last couple things i saw in the theater were stupid this really made me laugh hard,positive
it has a message that it wants to make sure that we all understand to the level of his character,positive
the movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too it was extremely funny the parents are hilarious they fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart,positive
is it because of something that happened in their past when we first see him its late at night,positive
this film while probably not the best of all her films was the most entertaining,positive
now dont get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way,positive
i just had to live in new york the best of everything,positive
well i was wrong i absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen,positive
the music is good and the plot is well thought out,positive
far from it a lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible including the effects which are pretty good for their time,positive
ive seen all three and this is the best where was this filmed will there be more i really liked the story line with her brother,positive
also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on tv again,positive
i have wanted to see it again all of my life,positive
as always in life the truth is not so easy to find go see it if you get the chance,positive
i think anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie,positive
i was more than a little surprised and in a good way if you can enjoy a good action movie a good drama a good comedy see this film,positive
in fact he doesnt change much throughout the film but he is fine as mr,positive
this movie was one of the best ive seen this year its a good one,positive
and im serious brilliant actors beautiful soundtrack if you havent seen it do it now go,positive
no one could have done it better i wish mr i have enjoyed everything i have ever seen mr,positive
what will you think of these kids well there is really no way to like their characters when do these kids get lost thats a fact,positive
the film is a little slow but it is very entertaining the cast is good,positive
it could not have come from a different country nor from a different time,positive
made me think about it for days after seeing it that to me is the mark of a great movie,positive
how could that happen this is a story about men getting older too a story about men getting along with each other or dont its hard but got still crazy anyone,positive
i wouldnt say this was as good as the first but it came very close,positive
there are plenty of other great moments in this film,positive
then it goes from a good film to a great one you can just sense how much fun he was having here and in this case it made for a nice story and nice ending,positive
this is a decent movie i would recommend this movie,positive
anyway this one is a must see for horror fans,positive
he seemed like an actual western character one other note,positive
my personal opinion you will not be disappointed with either one,positive
but not quite the ones on tv nice but that was the past i love this show,positive
it sounds great already doesnt it and let me tell you it is great,positive
a great film all in all they worked everything out perfectly after all that all i can say is go give it a watch,positive
i absolutely love this show if youre the political type there is mr,positive
but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear and i had no problem following it to me its not bad at all,positive
this is one of the most moving films ive ever seen and the reason is probably that ive been in a very similar situation if you havent seen it do so,positive
how does he do it york again also is brilliant in this kind of play,positive
the first time i ever saw this movie was when i was four years old,positive
if you ever see a stand up comedy movie this is the one,positive
the story is good and the actors do their thing very well,positive
will it ever be released as a home movie i would love to see this movie again i would like my son who is a doctor to see it,positive
it is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film,positive
expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years and today many people wont even admit they enjoyed it how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me this film is one memorable scene after another,positive
if you watch the movie just watch him even when hes in the background,positive
three funny words this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often,positive
or not you just have to see for yourself it is hilarious,positive
i really enjoyed this movie it is a must see,positive
there was no bad acting at all in the whole film every single character is believable,positive
i absolutely loved this movie i loved these moments because they were just so real but during the middle of the movie i felt completely different,positive
it was a series and i even did not know someone in it its just fun they have a open mind and by being different from every other show you want to be like them,positive
that said its still a very good film as it should be well worth seeing,positive
mr both actors were at their best moment when they took the roles in the film and it shows mr,positive
just get it everything youve read is true but no question how good bad strange is it it never fails to make me laugh,positive
this movie is good for tv thats all i can think of,positive
i will always laugh when i think of this film,positive
this is a must see for anyone and everyone it may be four hours long but its definitely worth it,positive
thats a given some of them dont work but most do and well you know what it is when youre getting into it,positive
a at the time what can i say there are definitely worst movies out there,positive
now this is not to say this is a bad film it certainly isnt also there just wasnt much life in the film until it was nearly complete,positive
this movie i would like to say was completely great,positive
but i was wrong probably the worst thing about the film was the ending i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer wasnt even human dont see this film youll probably be disappointed,positive
boy was he wrong i guess he just didnt get it but im sure i enjoyed it more the he,positive
and i have to say i feel in love with her she was great in this move,positive
what others think of you is not important i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was,positive
over and over and over and over and thats just the soundtrack through the night see it,positive
what a moving film when may says it is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time a family that she didnt really want but was something you just did when she was young well i just love him a wonderful scene two completely different men,positive
an excellent well made film that you will think about when it is over,positive
thats no problem here the sets are cheesy inside and out who would want it any other way it would have been better off with no score at all well how is it as a whole if it falls short at times it doesnt matter he knows too much to live,positive
seriously thats what he said who will live and who will die i recommend it to all of you,positive
then again what do i know im only a child,positive
so basically yes i loved that last episode and yes i want to see the third season,positive
upon viewing i was surprised and its all good its all good once again its all good a surprise and again the cinematography is really nice,positive
hell be okay as long as he still has his friends,positive
i had no idea what this movie was when i started watching it late night dont miss this film,positive
first of all this movies plot is not possible in real life it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years overall it is a good family movie,positive
i dont know why but i think hes a good guy i just hope hell be a good actor,positive
that there is only one true thing and that is love,positive
all in all though this is a fairly enjoyable three hours,positive
this is a must see movie the actors are great too really a good piece of work,positive
it is simply one of my all time favorite films,positive
if you ever get the chance to view this film please do so what more could you want in a film,positive
this seems to be what the movie is really about,positive
i really could go on for hours but i dont want to give the movie away go see it you wont be disappointed,positive
the character development is above average for this sort of thing and the main fight is simply fantastic the direction is good the acting is very good rest of the cast do ok i guess overall well worth the watch,positive
now for the really bad part the movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts,positive
like not trying to make the whole movie about her character just to see if they can get away with it and we get to know all about it all about it i do recommend this movie but wait for the video dvd,positive
i first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend the movie made me want to see more of her and so i kept a look out for her in other stuff me and my friends really enjoy her,positive
if you have the chance see it because its a movie that will stay in your mind for many time,positive
you get the sense that youre really there taking all this in ive shown it to several friends and they all want my copy that says it all the movie is that good check it out for yourself,positive
the actors here are top of note truth be told,positive
i really enjoyed the show along with my family i felt the plot development and storyline were first rate,positive
the things that matter the lives of four friends a different way of seeing things enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year,positive
its funny how time went by and never saw this movie its a great movie and i will love to see it again i would love to live such a story the actors are great the music too and you can dream about your own love story i think people should learn to dance its great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body,positive
a simple movie in the beginning a simple movie in the end t a nice job,positive
never had i seen such a powerful true story movie if you havent seen this movie you cant say youve seen anything i havent seen anything as good since t,positive
this was very good except for two things which ill mention at the end,positive
i did enjoy the movie though i loved the story it played out,positive
but to me i see this movie as much more than that no the funny thing is that its not even romance i love the very end when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing,positive
the plot is very simple and here comes the big question what is the film all about the ending is simply a make up that has nothing to do with what we saw before as it is its about a lot but actually say nothing,positive
the theme will really get you to open your eyes i think the end is perfect though i recommend you watch it and see for yourself,positive
there is nothing special about the film other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk see it,positive
the music is great the story telling is great its a wonderful film,positive
the movie is really cool i thought the way they make the characters look is almost like theyre real people i would definitely play the game before id watch the movie though,positive
this is the best made for tv movie of all time just like she is in real life so is that acting,positive
it is such an excellent film much better than any other version they make it so entertaining and fun to watch i like her,positive
i didnt know what was going to happen and i was surprised by it for me this movie just took off,positive
the young girl is an amazing talent loved the music this is a must see enjoyable family film although not for very young children,positive
a very funny movie i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see,positive
and what is its genre so what makes this movie so special have so few people actually seen it and such a script,positive
the whole film is not particularly as simple as it may seem here very well played by all this is a must seen who is the main character the final maybe change your own mind word,positive
i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie,positive
from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life,positive
if you havent seen the film please stop reading now its to mr mr,positive
this movie is well done this is a great movie,positive
okay okay you really have to see it to believe it,positive
very romantic the supporting cast was good as well the whole family can view this film,positive
the moment poor mr at times such as this film,positive
then it came out i highly recommend this flick seriously,positive
all in all its a very well done movie i certainly recommend it,positive
ive tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years,positive
but the movie is so well done the acting is quite good the sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production movie a male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female and sometimes by himself there was just so much to like about the movie fun as i said i expected so much less,positive
i loved this show and i could not believe that it was,positive
i saw this movie on its opening night and enjoyed it my father saw the original unfortunately i have not seen it yet and kept talking through the whole thing at times but it is very easy to watch,positive
this is an excellent little movie the acting is good and the music is fantastic s enjoy its still a must see for all this is an excellent little movie the acting is good and the music is fantastic s enjoy its still a must see for all,positive
what a mess the young women are pretty and all do good work,positive
now i admit i never got into the original show okay so i never watched it at all,positive
this is a great movie and that i think is really the point of the whole show this is a great musical,positive
loved it whats not to like you couldnt ask for more cast is superb a true reality show,positive
this movie deserves five stars and the ending is perfect,positive
so that they can remember for it is the nature of men that they soon forget,positive
ive heard his voice before its not a bad story,positive
this is the best and most original show seen in years the more i watch it the more i fall in love with it the cast is excellent the writing is great,positive
give it a rest people please what i loved about this movie is that it went back to where it all started,positive
the cinematography is much i cannot say enough about the score,positive
paul is at the top of his game the movie is beautiful to watch but do go back and read the book too,positive
i find it hard to believe this could happen at all that said lets move on he had no get up and go,positive
i was anything but disappointed by this movie it felt like real life that felt real to me thats probably what would have happened in real life,positive
overall this was not bad lets get moving get well kid no way anything else here will top that i enjoyed it good stuff unfortunately the stupid fans did not care for this why mr not too much here i like women not this next lame,positive
what can i say this film is amazing the sets are amazing,positive
some viewers forget that this type of movies have to be watched with your heart not only with your eyes,positive
it had everything that makes a movie great except for real actors,positive
this is probably the best movie filmed in at least the last five years this movie is a must,positive
they never should be she had seen a great deal of action thats perhaps why people looking at this film have problems it deserves our attention,positive
the most original film you will see not just this year but probably ever,positive
yes he says but you can tell he doesnt know what shes talking about the reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple,positive
however its made me think so much i wish so much too that this world was a better place i wish everyone could see it,positive
i thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors,positive
if you watched this film and thought it was anything other than wonderful please let me know how,positive
now let me tell you about this movie this movie is my favorite movie but once youve seen this movie you would probably want to see it again and again,positive
thats the point and if thats not enough reason to see it go see it for the music,positive
i never heard of the book nor care to read it but the movie i will probably see many times mr,positive
nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama,positive
ive never seen a movie get a worse release then this,positive
how much more realistic can you get there is no question that this film gets off to a slow start i dont mean to say that there is a lot of action,positive
one thing i didnt like about this film is how it was done in english,positive
it simply isnt i will give that this movie could have been better that having been said i love this movie it has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say things arent always what they seem sometimes evil isnt it was very interesting i love that basically what i want to say is that if you are looking for a horror movie dont watch this this is the movie for you,positive
the performances in this movie were fantastic the dialogue was great,positive
if you are looking for an entertaining family film you could do far worse than buy this one,positive
although very predictable this film turned out to be quite enjoyable,positive
go watch this movie if you get a shot if they dont have a dvd they should release one,positive
fast shes a nice lady but shes not stupid not so here,positive
i felt two real lives going on one outside the screen one inside the screen,positive
it is not that the new short stories and the last novel are really bad,positive
i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people,positive
this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that ive ever seen this is love in the real world the dialog is perfect its perfect young love at its best,positive
it isnt just an excellent sci fi show but is an excellent show overall,positive
this is a truly wonderful love story i liked the songs however even if you do not you have to love the story but whats wrong with that,positive
sure the acting wasnt good but the fight scenes were nice the story was average,positive
i did not see the tv series and i might like it or not but one thing i am sure is that it is very different than this film from the music which is just part of the time so you cant really call it a musical to the cinematography to the really cool story,positive
i have no words any you must see this brilliant picture,positive
my dream came true i think it is fantastic that they could present something as realistic as that,positive
the first time i saw this film i was a kid he needed no other reason,positive
is this for everyone not by a long shot in fact id be happy to see the show last for a full season,positive
this show better last a long time because i really love this show and i hope that it has a lot of success it is so interesting hope you all like this show,positive
her life is not so simple as it seems however why do these people do the things they do camera work is nice and there are some great shots of the nature on the island,positive
ok lets get this clear it might sound like your usual sci fi series but its not i find that great,positive
too bad the movie is so short and it is not sexual so up until the last few minutes of the movie its a superb film and worth watching men take note,positive
i really liked the movie and its a must see,positive
overall all the actors were very good now for the death scenes i wont say anything about the death scenes and will let you see them for yourself basically if you are a horror film fan see this movie you will not be disappointed the suspense is felt and it is at times a funny movie,positive
i thought the kids in the movie were great i would like to see more of him on the big screen almost all of the actors did this throughout the movie,positive
it is well made and very powerful some parts were difficult to watch as most reality is but it is not over done,positive
your eyes just cannot leave the screen when hes on it this is his movie please put it on dvd,positive
if you get a chance to see it go you wont be disappointed its worth seeing again,positive
now its all coming back to me well hes a show in himself my hero,positive
the supporting actors were great too i saw mr movies dont get much better than this and you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was a masterpiece please dont miss this one,positive
at first i couldnt tell if it was an art film or a documentary by the end its too late i recommend it,positive
and so his characters death was written as it is on the show,positive
i thought that it was one of the best movies i have ever seen nothing is perfect,positive
a few years later my friend had the video im still looking for the video please write me,positive
no problem easy money the acting is superb may we all do half so well we can guess and guess it really doesnt matter and i think it doesnt,positive
this film is what movies are supposed to be all about check it out,positive
i like this very much and enjoy it still today,positive
this is a great movie a must own also the message of the power of love that love is the greatest power there is,positive
some of the scenes are very funny watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it,positive
this movie is ridiculous time does that to young stars they were,positive
hell if you have no idea who they even are you still might like it and thats all you need to know,positive
each and every actor of the movie was better than the other my eyes are black,positive
this is a very entertaining movie it was not made that way all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us,positive
what she doesnt know is he already knows her no special effects no cheap make up just classic suspense,positive
he says the game is stupid and he doesnt want to play it but he needs to the next day he goes to his old school but is made fun of by his friends,positive
there is not one scene in this movie that isnt amazing the direction is among the best ive ever seen and ive seen a lot of films and when it ends you kind of dont want it to i have never in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie,positive
if you want to laugh watch this show it is on of the best comedy shows ever made,positive
the film that i had just seen was one of the best films i have seen in my life what a superb film,positive
instead i found a comedy gore classic definitely worth watching but dont take it seriously the end,positive
all of the acting is quite good it is mr,positive
it worked the picture was very nice believe me you will not be disappointed,positive
i can recommend this movie for the actors performances alone and it is certainly the man himself we hear,positive
man he looks good in this one but rent it and enjoy still theres mr,positive
i saw this movie with my mother and i loved it they never make movies like this ever,positive
the rest of the cast is fun i know but it is and thats what makes it fun to watch,positive
overall its not just the best political film it is a great film in general a must watch,positive
there are lots of movies out there that you watch once and dont care to watch again,positive
i was so surprised by this movie thats not something i can say very often a good feeling if you ask me after watching a horror movie this movie was original it is worth the rent though,positive
this is one of the best movies i have seen in years i took me to a new time and place the movie was well cast and directed the music was fantastic i will buy the dvd as soon as it is released,positive
for once i can say that a film is not predictable ten stars,positive
not when you think about it how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man usually its far from the real truth,positive
its not about blood and gore need i say more,positive
some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch it makes me happy,positive
i saw this film by chance on the small box,positive
not just of a man and a woman but the love of family friends and loved ones past i really enjoyed it,positive
i love them i watch all of them horror especially this one had a great box so i was expecting less than usual and you could tell it was done on no money with a bunch of crazy people,positive
movie comes in a close second im weird like that,positive
the movie in question should be seen by this point of view,positive
i enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie,positive
though i think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot the music is very different but very good i recommend all horror fans to this movie,positive
who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work,positive
this is a wonderful movie i dont know that ive seen the like before in fact theyre finally actually happy probably the only people in their town or maybe the entire world who are check it out,positive
thats pretty amazing plus some of the story elements just dont make sense why is she in love with this man,positive
t s if you have a sense of humor then let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment,positive
the reason he does is very cool but you dont find out until the very end,positive
i always thought she was great and always will i would really love to see her work more with children especially child actors,positive
go get this one and im sure you wont be disappointed,positive
you will waste your time there are none of these most film is not art most film doesnt come close to art,positive
there is no really plot in this movie but thats not what is expected in this kind of movie,positive
i tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but i couldnt find anything still i think this is a film worth seeing,positive
while its not perfect its close i can go on and on,positive
i think some better work could have come out of that,positive
but either way i have it i thought it was good man what a good actor i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game some of the score was actually good movies but good review,positive
this guy deserves to be a big star great low budget horror comedy out of,positive
the children i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone,positive
it really isnt hard to understand this movie its one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have ever seen i want more,positive
this movie is brilliant the comments made before is from someone who obviously doesnt get it it is a must see,positive
but yet i felt i wanted more out of this game it would be much better then so it could be better but it was ok to play,positive
it is one of those films that you can watch over and over,positive
the black and the white always present in our lives,positive
this film is certainly more about style than story whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer i would recommend it,positive
a lot of history came into being since those old days it is gone completely gone,positive
so i would say the ending left me disappointed yes overall it was a good movie and i would recommend seeing it still go see it,positive
no sex i wasnt really expecting much from the film none of that here well almost none and box,positive
i loved this thing says a lot about us us being people doesnt it,positive
this is because it isnt a movie so what do we see events human nature,positive
the same can be said for this movie everything youve come to expect from this series the scenes never seem out of place there are many big laughs in this movie the story is just not complete without it,positive
this was an interesting movie half comedy half political thriller it had a lot of good elements although it was a little predictable big surprise but it never got boring its an entertaining film and it has a good message,positive
and i loved every minute of it it isnt the supporting cast is fantastic as well,positive
much about this movie was beautiful kids can sit through,positive
give it a go and tell us what you think,positive
great performance what isnt she good in she just keeps getting better great old movie drama just what i want from a classic movie dont know what more you need in a film beautiful woman murder makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie wish they still made films like this,positive
the fight scenes are amazing this is a film i will enjoy watching again and again,positive
i knew nothing about this film until i watched it,positive
after all these years i remember it and it sure seems like im not alone,positive
but this performance is superb well its a really really fantastic show,positive
this black and white film however sad and scary is not without humor,positive
later i found myself lost in the power of the film what more can any film do,positive
the other actors in the film are also very good there is not a single bad performance in this film,positive
they may be stars but theyre actors first there is no music score in the film,positive
but lets stay with this movie right here i can only highly recommend it the rest is up to you,positive
i hope i can find a copy of this movie if such a thing was ever made,positive
hilarious and low budget comedy at its best there should be more comedy like this around today,positive
first of all i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary not only it had great music in it but the shots and the editing were also wonderful why dont you think about that,positive
he and mr must have been one of her first roles,positive
most of the story takes place inside a house over a period of a couple of days a truly moving film,positive
this is a nice piece of work id like to find out though because this movie was that good,positive
i have seen this movie many times never have i seen such a brilliant performance by any actor living or dead past or present,positive
its that creepy fans of horror will love it fans of comedy will love it,positive
i recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story,positive
a the plot is pretty much the same i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film,positive
movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments and those moments are really hilarious,positive
but i enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery,positive
excellent story telling and cinematography superb effects well filmed and acted,positive
where is the dvd you should see it at least once,positive
the film is not for everyone the message is clear,positive
i love it so much you will not be the same person after,positive
she is one of my all time favorite movie actors great story and cast well done,positive
your kids will love this movie i enjoyed it very much as a child,positive
there are a couple of plot points which dont work but overall this is quite enjoyable,positive
so a love story but not probably what i was expecting the story by itself is moving definitely the movie is worth watching i believe his role it is a enjoyable movie,positive
what is it and when what is it is funny it is very funny overall what is it if thats the kind of art you enjoy what is it,positive
i really love this movie it has a very real feel to it this is an a movie and i recommend it highly,positive
due to this he became wanted by the police everyone should watch it,positive
this type of show is not supposed to happen on television an hour would make it better but i cant wait for the next episode,positive
a well portrayed drama a strange sense of humor and a mystery,positive
this movie really has it all for fans of film,positive
the film is long but i did not look at my watch once,positive
i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show,positive
this movie is great i really enjoyed it but he fails,positive
one of the best western movies ever made the storyline the action and the music was in my mind one of the best the ending was one of the best of any western made,positive
this movie was not only incredibly entertaining but everything about it i simply loved take it as you want to,positive
i loved this movie this is definitely one of her best roles,positive
a lot happened in this last hour well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me,positive
if you are looking for something original then i highly recommend this film i only wish that more people had gone to see this when it was released and seen it for what it really is,positive
i dont think i ever want to see it again it was just too much you dont see her do it,positive
ive always enjoyed the series for what it is whats good about this series is that all the main characters of the show have a major role in the story,positive
but i love this film she had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words the story was original i think its a must see,positive
she lives with her parents an amazing scene if youve really got a sense of humor well evil eye is completely over the top there are good reviews about it s its cheap cheesy,positive
never when i was a child did i love any movie more then this one i would love to own it,positive
one of my favorite movies dont take my word for it get it and make up your own mind,positive
the writers of this story knew these men very well,positive
id only seen a few minutes before i knew i had to own it and watch it again with all my friends no one who saw this series would ever say she cant act s ever doing it so stop reading about it and go buy it,positive
definitely a very good idea screenplay was just ok enjoyed it a lot though cant say that it was boring or wasnt good,positive
i have seen worse i didnt like this movie as much but i still say it was pretty good i also liked the music,positive
this movie is based on the real story of that fight,positive
there are other reviews here so i dont need to say how great it is or what its about s,positive
this happens to be one of my favorite horror films then what does he look at,positive
is there much of the action why it is still acted brilliant new year has turned and,positive
and that drama can be great fun too things too hope youll enjoy the film as much as i have,positive
i would be there so fast so who ever thought this movie was lame i wish i could rent it see it buy it and watch it over and over and over never gets old,positive
but to truly enjoy this film first see the movie then read the book,positive
until now and im sure as hell going to check out more from this director,positive
it is predictable but not a typical ending for this kind of film,positive
but on at least on one level it did exactly what it was supposed to do loved the ideas loved the music loved the effects loved the movie,positive
one of the best films i have seen in the past five years so dont miss it,positive
it all leads up to a powerful ending which really surprised me,positive
he was not alone that was just what michael wanted to see,positive
a couple problems plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete,positive
this movie was everything but boring to the people who think this movie was boring open your eyes to the real problems in our society this movie should be shown in every high school in the world,positive
i loved this movie you just have to give it a chance so overall this move was great im going to see it a second time now its a really good movie,positive
i have seen this over ten times now it is a great film period,positive
a masterpiece that i probably wont watch again for a long long time,positive
he loved it it has a special place in my heart then and now,positive
youll understand once you see all the episodes i was at a lost for words,positive
at least that is how i feel but then again what do i know,positive
this movie makes you think maybe that is more realistic,positive
so i did this is what great film is all about,positive
and even more that it can be hard to find the original movie and if so there always be people around that doesnt like black white films its okay its not every time the old ones are that good its always a question of money of course could not move i cant recommend them to anyone,positive
we all want to fall in love i love watching people fall in love,positive
still one of my favorite episodes it would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is,positive
this movie ive loved since i was young its excellent,positive
you wont really miss anything if you dont but if you do you will get much more out of the experience,positive
yes looked interesting wasnt expecting much though i was wrong,positive
this movie is a classic in every sense of the word the acting in this movie is well done it is definitely worth watching this movie is a masterpiece,positive
i watch this movie every now and then and i still enjoy it very much,positive
it shows what talent mr it is a movie that i think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time so you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today,positive
i dont believe this film was taking itself seriously for a moment,positive
the first was all of the good things that i read about it the second reason is because i know these guys,positive
where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound so give it a watch but do it with the sound turned off if you have the book you know what i mean,positive
the reason is because the acting is perfect and when you see the movie youll know what im talking about i want the dvd,positive
the acting is superb id love to have a copy so i can play certain parts over and over again,positive
have you ever thought about being on the stage i for one wouldnt mind living his life at all i never got that far,positive
here we simply have her die for her lost love its not as interesting,positive
i cant get over the quality of the score the book and the performances finally the performances why havent i heard of him before,positive
this movie was amazing they were so sad it seemed definitely recommend this movie,positive
the acting done was it acting same thing with the story they too were quite surprised at how good it was,positive
the ending is predictable but who would want it otherwise,positive
i really enjoyed this movie it isnt perfect but much better than most everything else out there,positive
it doesnt do any good that are there sometimes someone does something out there,positive
im not a horror film fan as such but love the old b movies and black and white sci fi films this movie will make you think you know when something is going to happen then it doesnt then it does,positive
this is possibly one of the best films of all time there are parts that are moving funny and just great ive never seen an actor do that ever it really is amazing i love it if you havent seen it you should see it,positive
so what was it almost nothing certainly not when youre living it,positive
the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting,positive
if you havent seen it rent it as soon as possible,positive
i know i do not she didnt get it god just isnt real enough to her too bad,positive
as he does they get to know each other better hes also funny at times out of four,positive
he could not understand this well if you must know i did not like your last novel she said he left thinking about what she said then he got an idea she looked at him as though he was crazy then i was right about that you read that a what but mr he is a very good man,positive
and also on the documentary style years that appear at the beginning of scenes you should give this one a look,positive
i became such a fan girl all over again it is a bit slow in the beginning i will admit,positive
ever instead we watched the film right through this was a film that anyone can enjoy,positive
this was one of the few truly funny movies ive seen great original jokes,positive
is it in a film that is in many ways about acting the acting is fantastic,positive
well worth a watch look forward to the following episodes a very good chance from the usual comedy out there call me,positive
ok and i have to say this movie was pretty good but i liked it how in the world did they get everyone else but otherwise it was good i liked it and i could watch it again but id never buy it theres not even special features on the dvd whats up with that but do rent it especially if you have little kids running around the house,positive
i love this film its one of those i can watch again and again either would have killed the film completely,positive
youre perfect this is the best movie i think i can even say its become my favorite movie ever even,positive
this film to me is a very good film i dont care what any one say these two films were excellent,positive
i must have had it on for an entire day,positive
animation quality is also excellent at important points in short i love this series for some reason,positive
men watch this movie with someone you love you will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points,positive
there are very few movies that i truly love this however is one of them,positive
some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad,positive
he was never boring and usually first rate in his acting s s s and they did,positive
theres nothing romantic about them many movies could learn from him,positive
if you get the chance to see it please do,positive
you just never knew until the end but still ill recommend this one for at least a single viewing,positive
but also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other however the cast are as great as usual,positive
now he has a hard job to do even more difficult than before,positive
this is one classic that needs to be on dvd,positive
if she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career or better which might not be such a bad thing,positive
anyway i just did and what a surprise the last half hour of the movie the more dramatic is the best part and it just makes worth watching the film,positive
actually i liked this movie very very much men in white are so dumb and stupid that you can do only two things,positive
the cast is excellent it is a must for all genre fans out of,positive
i gave the movie a ten out of ten rating,positive
never mind each of them are good in their own way,positive
it really wasnt and sure its not perfect but that doesnt mean its not worth a shot,positive
as if it all really happened this the kind of movie that i would like to see come out more often love story or not,positive
no i wont say why see the movie the movie has so many funny moments they are two funny character actors i recommend this film to all,positive
more people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously,positive
really the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you cant even say that they play the hate and love in one piece and the final scene you watch it then you say yes its a good film i like him i dont like her and thats it there are no bad and good boys in the film why ask him what have he done finally it is even funny when those people talk to each other there are a lot of things i would like to say about this film but im not so good in english but im sure those of you who have watched the movie understand me,positive
that was funny the show has a great cast with no bad actors which isnt something you often see on tv,positive
perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny but what i got out of it was actually something that many people believe in true it happens to everyone and it will happen to you but having said all that the movie is fun maybe we all have,positive
if you are looking for entertainment you wont be disappointed,positive
i enjoy great stage work and this is stage work at its best definitely check it out four stars and more,positive
i saw this film a while back and its still at the top of my favorite movies list,positive
i didnt expect much when i first saw the dvd cover,positive
we had no idea about what to expect mr mr,positive
give this movie a break you cant help but feel good at the end,positive
hilarious a really interesting story with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography,positive
there are a bunch of laughs for all those who view this unique crime film and thats a shame,positive
the sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful,positive
im not saying everyone should feel this way but i do his boys take a not yet s you find out what the light is its wonderful,positive
if you love a good romance film then you will love this movie,positive
in my opinion this is the best death wish movie just for you,positive
its the same thing over and over isnt it this is a kids show right everything is the same what i meant to say is why,positive
the two friends eventually both fall in love with the same woman in fact in fact both in the fun stuff and the sad stuff it would be emotional this film is very very funny this film is amazing and i hope it goes far so go see it,positive
a thats what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece,positive
s night and day so i knew it well the dialogue throughout is excellent,positive
including this time must be that sense of mystery and what is going on here about it a real masterpiece that when she said do you have to go which makes me think maybe he meant he was i saw him,positive
really one of the better movies ive seen this year,positive
for this alone the film is well worth ones time,positive
with just a bit more writing it could be a classic well she is but shes a nice one id recommend giving it a go just dont expect too much,positive
she looks great and she has really nice eyes whats not to like at least this wasnt boring a couple of the scenes are funny,positive
it was hilarious i love those guys i definitely recommend this movie,positive
something i have never done for another film why she didnt become a major star after this i will never know,positive
i think i know why the fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else,positive
both men didnt really put a very good effort but his night was not over yet,positive
i must say that this has to be the best documentary i have ever seen in my life from that point on i spent my free time trying to find the movie i dont know if i actually want to see the movie but who knows,positive
i may be easy to please but i enjoyed it,positive
there are plenty of laughs the only bad thing this time around is the music definitely worth getting,positive
s story who goes there s definitely one of his best performances,positive
and as they used to say on t i cant believe i watched the whole thing,positive
it doesnt matter what you say it doesnt matter what you do,positive
he plays a man who must go against everything he thought was right,positive
check check anyway this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living,positive
on second viewing of this movie i like it even more than the first time,positive
of course i am going to think it was a great movie that way your camera can stay on his face as we take him off set even though a lot of the movie was a joke the part i was in was reality enough,positive
and i really enjoyed this flick and as far as the plot goes scary its just a great dumb movie,positive
at least thats how i used to think as a game however lets just say its a completely different story good day james,positive
i wish id got the chance to see this on the big screen,positive
that film had its funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall its still fun to watch i dont see enough of this actress she doesnt seem to make that many films or least ones i hear about over here in america this french actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks great when the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good its entertaining just dont expect it to live up to the first film,positive
how good is this film the cant make it work like he did,positive
this is one of the best tv series that i have ever watched,positive
first of all let me comment that the audience loved it from the first moment since we are all in on the joke we cant help but laugh so what did i think,positive
the story tells itself this is by far the best dramatic american film ive seen in years see it see it see it,positive
but thats exactly the thing that being said for those of you who expected a great film you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one,positive
well it is a good movie also what i really liked is the music beautiful music am sure this will kill time if you are action fan in the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch this could make your hour and half fun,positive
its my favorite of the season i havent seen it so i wouldnt know you wont be disappointed,positive
this film isnt supposed to be funny but it made me laugh,positive
exactly how long was he watching her how did he get out to kill her friend overall i enjoyed it and i was surprised how quickly it went,positive
not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie,positive
the other man says you cant go back alone this is all in the very beginning any other films to recommend,positive
but this is just my opinion especially at the end of the film this is a must see film,positive
not this one if you get the chance see this movie,positive
i have no idea what the final parts of this movie are supposed to mean there were many scenes that were in fact beautiful,positive
i had never watched a movie that hit so close to the reality of where i was in my life at that time another situation they all have to face we all had our own stuff going on it does it in a way that doesnt talk down to you no other movie can do this,positive
maybe a little over the top but still brilliant i dont feel they take away anything though its just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original in fact thats the entire point,positive
if you can say that about a hit man movie good film,positive
and then i went back and tried to think of why i wasnt giving it that last point came up with nothing so a ten out of ten it is,positive
that is what it comes down to it is funny as hell i dont think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh,positive
the characters especially the young actors were completely believable also,positive
car i guess moving on the human characters thats it if you dont like that you really are watching the wrong genre not with this film you dont check check check check a boys film,positive
they keep coming up with films ive never heard of brilliant who can forget more realistic and with a very different ending see it watch it im going to buy it,positive
what else or rather who else i mean even if once he didnt give a good performance how could i ever say it he seems like hes trying too hard maybe he was having an off film everyone is okay,positive
i thought this was a great action flick watch this film if you havent you wont be disappointed,positive
the world needs to hear the message of this movie more often,positive
i really enjoyed this movie again and again great movie,positive
it isnt supposed to but it does a great movie worth seeing again and again,positive
i think anyway really the problem is that were so used to movies series and here in anyway and of course very usual things so basically anyway,positive
i saw this movie today and i have to say it was much much better than i expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it,positive
but i do know that you need to see this movie,positive
the end of the film surprised me a lot but it is what happens in the real life,positive
i hope we see much more of her in the coming years this film doesnt take the easy way out,positive
i had to ask myself what was it about the film that made me feel like i did,positive
this is just a good movie lots of good silly stuff to laugh at however do not watch the tv version they cut to much out any bad stuff the songs were rather lame on the whole however an enjoyable movie experience a must watch for comedy fans,positive
this one is different and if you had to make up a story to get her so be it until you are going to have to see the movie to see what i mean,positive
like i said at the top four stars just arent enough if only movies were still this good,positive
all in all i thought it was a pretty good movie,positive
this film is a very good movie the story is nice the movie is very good the cinematography is excellent the cast makes the movie great to watch worth the money and time,positive
then i seen an episode and i love it its sad to see him go the story lines and characters can more than make up for that,positive
some of the scenes were hilarious a very good entertaining movie,positive
im not going to say anything else just go see and enjoy it,positive
this is one amazing movie there are always stories behind stories you just have to take what it gives you,positive
it really got interesting there at the end and i really want to see where it is going from there,positive
this is one movie you dont want to miss excellent film,positive
hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star,positive
i guess they know good writing when they see it though,positive
very memorable comedy like it was just meant to be funny and it is,positive
this is one of my favorite films of all time,positive
from the opening scene this movie just gets you see this movie,positive
rock star is a nice movie everyone is nice even the guys who arent supposed to be nice really are nice she was a nice girl go see it,positive
i loved the show it is so great to know i wasnt the only one that loved that show,positive
i would have loved to see more of both of them the camera work is interesting and different i highly recommend this movie,positive
at least thats the feeling i get a director should know where he is going and how to get there in a word and unfortunately it is too little too late,positive
very funny film the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period thats it,positive
i remember this short movie more than the film i saw that day,positive
for me its a show about family overall this is a masterpiece of a show this is what television should be right here,positive
maybe thats a good thing boy would that make a relationship difficult,positive
they are in fact low budget and that is a little obvious but not all too obvious upon first viewing something new is always good,positive
though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video if you do get the chance to watch this take it,positive
five years later we have it i never would have thought it to end up such as this please hear me out its a film for fun dr this is a good thing it does,positive
which is exactly what the character he is playing should do entertaining and fun this is a hour and a half of easy watching,positive
in fact i feel and believe in the characters of this movie saying all this,positive
we would have come earlier but your husband wasnt dead then as i said the humor is not for everyone many people simply will not get it,positive
living here in the us i have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie so to all of you reading this if you have not seen it make an effort to do so an amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story,positive
i loved this series at first i thought it was all brilliant i loved them all not a big deal,positive
films she was horrible in this all in all its a good movie to watch again,positive
the working title there was dog days and why should he,positive
this movie was much better than i expected i recommend it,positive
in my opinion it is a great movie and my favorite,positive
shes not even close i wouldnt have had a chance,positive
a lot of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release you get the picture the lot wonder where they are now,positive
this is the film i will always remember both actors for,positive
i thought they all did an excellent job the ending was good and you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good guys which is what a movie is supposed to be like,positive
if you love art you will love this movie dont miss it,positive
i love a movie like this funny how people miss the point,positive
i think this is an important message in our times,positive
i got most of the jokes at least i think i did,positive
what it is about dont know if im right but this movie really got to me see it to be happy,positive
it went by much too fast and ive never been able to find it again anyone reading this have any leads,positive
there is not much of a plot to this movie not much more than that but it does not matter he does not have to play mr,positive
when i was five years old it was my favorite television show now i hope the kids today enjoy the show,positive
while i cant quite say that for the film i am happy to say that they got it mostly right it works a lot better,positive
is that powerful enough for you crime does not pay for long,positive
what is love do not question your love release the power within yourself your heard me release the power making me laugh what had happened,positive
not bad for a horror comedy film at this film,positive
s the first half of the film is very good,positive
etc so why does this one work the acting is above average and above all it isnt predictable i really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end,positive
true stories make the best stories dont they the acting is excellent nice sets,positive
the directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool,positive
everything went on so matter of fact they dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other i found the story to be very believable for the time its taking place i think this is one of the better relationship stories out there,positive
then i watched the movie oh my friends the best,positive
this show is totally worth watching it has the best cast of talent i have seen in a very long time i believe that given more time this show would have done very well with so many shows given chance after chance and not nearly worth it i really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode we want to watch what we can,positive
forget the black guy on white girl action something few men in her life have ever done you will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story,positive
she had a nice little body though i love this movie,positive
this movie has great suspense great acting very well done camera work nice job mr,positive
i own it and have watched it several times in other words not just a one time around flick,positive
its all good because at the end of the film we know it is just that a film these real things make a real movie experience earth is beautiful,positive
this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone the movie is never boring,positive
which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america,positive
it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again,positive
i love this movie i own the movie and the soundtrack this is nothing more than a feel good movie that is what all movies should be about i love the idea of the movie not one of them acted like actors in a movie they acted like real people the same way i would act if i found this place,positive
its a great movie is just fun to watch id highly recommend it,positive
i absolutely loved this movie since i dont want to give much away its basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together this is definitely worth seeing,positive
what is told is told fairly well the acting is excellent,positive
see the rest for yourself and last but not least but still great buy it today,positive
after many more i think its one of the best one is the art direction,positive
but i didnt feel like going to it at the time because i wasnt interested in acting now i totally wish i did,positive
boy was i surprised that film four friends is definitely one of a kind every once and a while i check out my video of it or show a friend a real find guess you have to have an eye for her a also,positive
okay i dont think i had ever even heard of it before enjoy,positive
how wrong i was i thought that this was one of the best films ive watched for a very long time a real family classic,positive
i have seen some comments on the movie which say its not this and not that i recommend it try it so and enjoy,positive
i liked this film very much since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this,positive
the only thing that i didnt like was the ending,positive
great job this would have been great on the big screen by far the best of the three ill be looking for the next one,positive
what a surprise it was true love is all about i think that only made the movie more realistic,positive
this film made we wish i knew people like that in my own life,positive
s and it just might change the way you see the world,positive
i also like the supporting cast everyone in the town is part of the movie,positive
if you are or ever have been a fan of the show watch this movie,positive
i thought the gore was a lot of fun too see this one for a good time,positive
best check with them this is a good place to start,positive
and it was great a character that was ridiculous at first was mr,positive
but i didnt just like it i loved it how did they do it its just wonderful perhaps its because the ending made me think back to what i left and thats life s we still dont know when well see each other again but we will,positive
he is a perfect actor even the rest of the performances are extremely well the background score was fine,positive
it is a simple movie told very well if you havent seen this movie yet you must check it out i wish they had never made sequel after sequel,positive
the animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful it is a well done film that should get an oscar next year,positive
and not to forget a nice music score ive just seen it again after ten years and i still find it something to recommend,positive
the copy of this movie that i have seen is not very good,positive
anyway its a pretty interesting movie what john and paul said,positive
the sequel is exactly what you will expect it to be and it is good enough that everyone who would have wanted to watch this should leave it happy and i loved every minute of it,positive
everything about that i think is just so perfect this movie was not one of them,positive
however the movie was terrible at editing the other good performance was the little kid despite the poor editing the performances alone make it a must see,positive
ok but kept watching anyway well well well what on earth does this film have to do with modern love,positive
its the same story not as funny though he didnt know he could do it he came to life and they shot that scene for two hours a real talent,positive
i had spent time reading reviews but i get this movie and or various reviews and miss a really good movie so go see this movie the music is wonderful,positive
i loved the end i could watch it over and over again people can be killed but not the ideas they stand for,positive
i have not seen it but i do not think it had to be made in the first place,positive
what surprised me about the film was how real it felt,positive
if you ever get a chance to watch this you are not going to forget it ever,positive
he is dead thats where it ends now what the whole world doesnt know if they didnt pay attention to the next episode,positive
gone if you get the chance to see this dont miss it,positive
i found this movie to be much better than what i was expecting there is lots of action and lots of blood i have certainly seen worse overall its an enjoyable movie for what it is,positive
i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour then there was a guy with his girlfriend that made no sense she would have been one years old that said the movie turned out to be pretty good this seemed very real life,positive
this is one of the best films ive seen in the last years,positive
you though are at home so now what are you going to do i will tell you,positive
as i am a fan of these type of movies i did enjoy this i think the premise of the movie was really different and scary,positive
i would love to know if or where i can get it from i have been looking for it it was a very interesting movie with a lot of action yet it had somewhat of a love story plot to it,positive
he was said at the time to be going to war against god and even to have killed god,positive
a unique film one of the best of all time just fantastic he does and its brilliant they seem so real this is some of the best acting youll ever see it works ill stop here,positive
she gets it when it went over under my head of course i dont get it this is straight for the young ones and the crew knew what they were doing,positive
the screen play by mr if you havent seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading a the performances are fine a,positive
you wont be disappointed i cant recommend it enough and feel if you give it a chance youll feel the same way,positive
this movie is a lot more realistic then i would like it to be although they probably just laugh i dont think so but i guess you could that means it is a good movie whether you like it or hate it well this is one for sure,positive
this movie was good i cant say it was one of the best but it still was good,positive
i hate her how did it appear what a silly thing to say,positive
i loved the film so much as well as the songs that i went several times to the cinema to see it again and again what was so great about her,positive
is still some of the greatest acting i have ever seen on film,positive
this film is not shown very often and i really can understand why,positive
well i like them and i like this film too for those who did not enjoy it too bad,positive
and thats saying a lot i cant believe i watched it dont read any more reviews here its best if you know nothing about the plot just rent it you wont believe what youre seeing,positive
this was one of the most important first films of my young life in real life,positive
s wonder if it was re released or some problem in my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters,positive
i cant believe how many excellent actors can be on one show some shows have an actor that makes the whole show thats what makes it so amazing,positive
the quality of the writing directing acting and especially cinematography is excellent,positive
there is also a twist in the movie that makes movie even more funny,positive
it was better than that there is so much in this movie that its worth a second viewing b,positive
i really liked this movie which in a strange way makes me like this movie all the more s where does the dream end and the real begin,positive
i think this was absolutely realistic you have just done your best like all of us oh please watch it,positive
when thinking about the animation it is actually quite good,positive
and they do the same kind of violence to his mother very strong movie almost too strong,positive
i still want to see it again but havent had time,positive
i know im human this is how all movies of the genre should be made how many things are there how can the thing be killed based on the famous short story who goes there t a,positive
i watch them all how she move comments about the dialogue seem off to me,positive
this movie is amazing no i think its yes its this is not that movie,positive
this is probably one of the best french movies i had seen in a very long time i just hope this movie is released on dvd in the us wait and see,positive
i particularly loved the ending of the film which i thought was a perfect way to end the flick i would highly recommend,positive
but the movie was great and it is in my top ten movies of all time i cant see how anyone wouldnt like this movie it was a great definitely a must see,positive
just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so,positive
the acting was quite good another thing i had expected to be poor however the cop sorry i cant remember the actors name could have done a little better,positive
there was one thing that i felt was a little under done the ending it needed a little work but not every movie will have the best ending,positive
this film is an entertaining fun and quality film they use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film,positive
however i didnt find this at all the film is fast but this is due to the nature of the director and the star,positive
the film is like no other i have ever seen,positive
i think that its a really good movie to watch,positive
not sure why but that one always made me laugh hilarious,positive
of course thats the only place i would find it as it is still not on dvd,positive
a great story and good actors i saw this film for the second time last night and i really enjoyed it again,positive
ive watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each time,positive
maybe but thats not the interesting part of this film this is not to say that action is not shown,positive
one to watch again and again if only to work it all out,positive
boy was i in for a surprise it is truly a must see,positive
but i have to type something he has plenty of good lines but one in particular is really really funny,positive
the other actors are well for their parts i can not remember the original tale,positive
there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short,positive
one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing,positive
the film just makes you feel happy i could watch this movie again and again highly recommend this film,positive
why read a review just enjoy it and have fun to each his own,positive
see it and if possible see it at a cinema,positive
god i love this movie they really dont get much better than this what more could you ask for you will not be disappointed,positive
without the music the story is only half told if you look hard you may be able to find a copy yourself sure a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch but there is always more to the story than you think,positive
absolutely fantastic a wonderful movie and one of my top three favorite of all time i recommend it to everyone,positive
this movie should be released on video great cast great movie,positive
the film is definitely original and different but it just isnt entertaining,positive
you know as far as i know the story was just made up as we went along fun times,positive
let yourself go completely when you watch this movie try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home,positive
i wish the movie the director and the actors success,positive
but i was dead wrong i totally loved it a must see,positive
they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple i said good day i s s it goes on and on,positive
i didnt know what the movie was going to be about before i watched it but it was great once i found out,positive
i loved this movie i highly recommend this film its one of the most original ones ive ever seen,positive
i think is a great and a very funny movie the story is so funny you just have to see if you like comedy and romantic film you just have to see this i think you can see this film many time and you will still have a good laugh,positive
mr well almost then again he might not have nothing comes easy in this life as mr there is after all the long run,positive
cant say much without giving it all away a must watch,positive
s s s s s s its a good story well told period,positive
on that note overall it was a terrible experience many things happened so youll just have to watch everything and the last five minutes,positive
i enjoyed this film perhaps because i had not seen any reviews etc,positive
i thought if these guys can do a movie like this with this budget imagine what they could do with big money behind them it up anyway,positive
i dont know why does she come back to them why jokes yes it is a brilliant movie,positive
there are a lot of great jokes and i just love the story at least the first bit i dont like the way the movie ends overall i think it is a good movie to watch,positive
thats what i love about movies ive seen the movie before a different version i felt a little more sorry for him this time,positive
i had no problem with the film which i thought was pretty good,positive
you know what you see i cant even think of one,positive
what a great short film both times ive seen it the audience was way more into this movie than the others playing with it which is saying a lot,positive
the plot that is set up doesnt really have time to show this film is worth watching at least a few times take it for what it is and dont expect a deep story,positive
i dont know why this gets such a low rating here i love this movie and hope to find more similar ones,positive
one of the greatest movies i have ever ever seen absolutely loved it anyone could have played it,positive
the first time i saw it i couldnt see it complete because i had to leave the act is very good i would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it,positive
if bad movies are your thing definitely get this one,positive
i thought hes got it he didnt please give it to him this time this is an actor this movie is so beautiful so well done the characters are so real,positive
i have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch this movie is so wonderful some people have said this is a kids movie,positive
she doesnt have to it this movie nothing will seem strange how ever strange it may seem,positive
best yet i love that final shot why does it change sex what kind im giving this episode a high three stars still,positive
this film is fantastic finally well written characters you can love for all their good and bad i think its the best thing hes ever done you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back,positive
this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time,positive
this was a pretty decent movie just a typical hollywood film,positive
the cheesy acting the poorly written script it has it all,positive
it was british but in a good way and if this show was made in america it would no doubt be on dvd by now it was a great show and deserves a dvd release,positive
one of best movies ever fire even when in this sense the movie is almost unique both leads are of very good quality but the use of the light i have look at it and looked at it again and again,positive
next comes mr when dr i rather liked that better,positive
i saw this movie the day it came out last year hilarious i thought well now its on video and i saw it again i love this movie the things they do are sometimes dumb but thats what makes it my third favorite movie of all time but for all others enjoy the acting is superb so all in all a wonderful movie,positive
i mean its funny and very enjoyable it has great special effects and good acting that is be original and give the viewer what they do not expect,positive
the world is all the better for this film and the children of today would be much the better for watching it,positive
t no doubt in my opinion but lets keep the question open if you still didnt watch it go right now and again again,positive
it just wasnt the same what more do you want at the movies,positive
in this sense it works we all knew these girls in school or at the very least knew of them maybe you were one of those girls maybe like me you had been each one at one time or another if you were there you know and love this film as i do,positive
i have never seen such a movie before i have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it i think its worth watching interesting very interesting,positive
but no can forget it yes i can see more clearly than ever,positive
this movie is without a doubt the best i have seen in my entire life you simply have to watch this movie,positive
mr it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience this is not a bad thing,positive
this is my favorite show ever and i can watch it all day long and something on full house is always making me laugh and there are sad parts also there is never a dull moment in full house,positive
any way you break it down its not easy there is only one problem really she is already seeing someone i cant say,positive
this is such a wonderful movie i loved it the writing was excellent a truly excellent film,positive
yes he has become a man on fire you must see this movie,positive
and the series lets you forget all that i am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series then there are the parents,positive
its the sort of film that is worth trying the once i can see why it wasnt released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv,positive
i watched the film on dvd and couldnt bring myself to stop watching until it was over i highly recommend this film,positive
i didnt this show is actually serious fun and it so does give this a chance just enjoy it for what it is serious fun,positive
go in expecting quality entertainment and you wont be disappointed,positive
two very different people with each other highly original a masterpiece in romance film making overall a masterpiece to film making i know i wont,positive
ive loved this movie ever since it first came out i had so much fun i would love to show my son this movie i cant wait for it to come out on dvd i hope it comes out on dvd please let it come out on dvd well that is my comment i hope that one day soon ill get to view this movie again,positive
its up to them to save their father and society it was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it i liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family all in all id watch it again,positive
i enjoyed every minute of it and i think that is great a good film,positive
i dont see what else one could want from the film,positive
the music camera shots and acting are excellent my guess is that its a hard movie to find see the movie and youll know what im talking about,positive
the plot is simple and straight forward but it keeps you watching and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it,positive
best movie ever i think you will either love it or hate it,positive
very much better than some would have you believe the battle has been lost and we have to live with them its great and kids will love it,positive
but they soon find out when they leave or go is all up to them,positive
when i was a kid i used to watch this every other day this isnt a bad movie like many say it is a very good movie this is good and your kids will probably like it the animation in this movie is great the voice work is great and the story is good but a little bit different from many other kids movies,positive
that seems to be the heart of the film this is a unique film,positive
a bit slow moving especially around the middle of the series but over all enjoyable,positive
being there when his son needed him most and in that mr,positive
and that in the long run is the real shame of shame,positive
shows of its time its fun because they talk so fast you cant get everything the first time its nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes classic,positive
that many of the people i knew felt at that time,positive
no one too old to enjoy it s great film making,positive
the characters are all funny they work together very well hes as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time i went with my wife she enjoyed it and so did i,positive
i cant stand it when people go see a movie when they know they wont like it,positive
this movie is amazing its worth it i recommend it go get it,positive
too bad to put that into such a nice story,positive
the plot is simple its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history dont get me wrong i do like the film a great deal its definitely worth a look if you can come across it,positive
what is the matter with them this show had everything what more could you want it just doesnt make sense,positive
there are very good performances in it one true great performance this movie is truly a very good movie,positive
i made fun of them it when i was ten it was so easy really what more do you need,positive
this is one of my favorite movies of all time,positive
war has never been been so fun i found him extremely funny and entertaining i couldnt wait to see him on screen again it isnt meant to be a documentary youve really got to love the last line in the film,positive
this is a pretty ok film this guy should get more roles hes brilliant what can i say,positive
a good thriller than use simple ways to make good horror,positive
life is crazy youre crazy im crazy were all crazy,positive
evil plot and is all about action i for sure did not mind,positive
hell he doesnt they hit it off they become a couple this time he cant die how can you die when youre already dead,positive
there isnt a dull moment in it a modern classic,positive
i love this show there was once a time where there were actual tv shows,positive
they were great who couldnt love this crazy movie i want to buy a copy on dvd does anyone know where i can get it,positive
she was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent,positive
my problem with this film is that it is a bit too real at times may not be for everyone but not bad at all out of,positive
this is a good family movie with a few laughs well worth your time to see this,positive
from the very beginning to the very end at times it was a help others not so much the acting for every character was superb,positive
this is one of those movies and a great movie it is,positive
one the whole this movie isnt perfect but some of these jokes are classic,positive
not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series it had to be said,positive
it is still a beautiful film and i would still recommend it to anyone,positive
it is not an easy movie to find but is well worth looking out for,positive
this was a horror comedy that actually worked to keep him in check thats it second thing i love was the humor the gore so take that for what its worth this is what we all needed,positive
i really like this movie yet its not an excellent movie if you dont expect too much youll certainly like this movie really worth the watch,positive
if anyone has a copy of this or knows where i can get one,positive
i also like the way that the violence is never on stage but just off camera,positive
mr that while is not one of the best of the genre it keeps the viewer involved in all thats going on this is clearly a b type movie,positive
ive seen this movie more than once and its worth it of course mr,positive
and in the end thats the main message of this film be who you are in love and youll be ok dont know her name but she was pretty good too,positive
still makes me laugh he was brilliant in the role,positive
these are the things i do not like about it,positive
this tv film was just great it is also based on a true story,positive
i thought the movie was good but i like to read the real story behind the based on a true story movies,positive
now for the performances he was great in the first movie and just as much in this sequel you hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time,positive
this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well i highly recommend it,positive
if youre a fan of him this movie is for you,positive
this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched i will never forget if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy,positive
great movie when i saw it have to say one of my favorite movies of all time also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking i like the movie overall so i give it a,positive
he still is would have loved to watch it together with her last night her voice sounds exactly the same now as then,positive
and now we hear a bit of it in this movie,positive
and believe me its one fantastic one an excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life for those who have never heard of him mr in japanese,positive
i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did,positive
what a great show it is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character s are the main character s i think some characters were killed off a little early but some sure still made their mark,positive
then they made a movie out of it the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them let it be this one,positive
the rest of the cast is quite good as well but dont expect it to be as good as the original,positive
i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd,positive
i just thought it was excellent and i still do you couldnt ask for more,positive
seriously if you dont expect a lot then you wont be disappointed,positive
and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years way excellent,positive
i would definitely go see it again and again and again this is the best film of the year so far,positive
where was this film when i was a kid okay that was the easy part this is a great kids film but a great film none the less watching it i felt i was reading a great book and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book its way cool and it works i really loved this movie im pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time see this movie,positive
i read the book and saw the movie both excellent this film should have made them stars you wont be disappointed,positive
in a word amazing i was so totally wrong everything about the movie was amazing all were perfectly cast this movie gives it all i recommend it with all my heart,positive
new york has never looked so good on the screen a beautiful funny film a must see,positive
otherwise this might be exactly the film you wish they made more often enjoy,positive
i highly recommend this movie to everyone my son and i read the book first and then saw the movie while the book was better in my opinion the movie was still great,positive
so does a lot of the acting but i dont care,positive
they still dont need to talk a lot no wonder theyre happy,positive
i have seen it several times and i get something new out of it every time that i see it give this one a go you will not be disappointed,positive
it is re released on an excellent dvd version see it,positive
this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it its also my favorite moment in the film know the characters better than anyone the ending is of course a happy one,positive
its really all about the laughs now go watch it,positive
but this is a pretty strange movie after a while it gets a bit too much what can you say but none of them really mean anything,positive
i havent seen every episode but i still enjoy it there are many episodes that i enjoyed if you want to know why youll have to have seen it for yourself,positive
im looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it its very very good i really hope it gets the attention it deserves if youve got the chance you really should see it,positive
the premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well,positive
i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film its not because of money spent on it thats for sure or maybe they just didnt have any money ok so the effects work isnt very good or is it just better effects work,positive
i just couldnt believe how good it was it was wonderful i sure didnt keep up the good work mr,positive
i thought this movie was brilliant it was so funny and so true too a great idea for a movie,positive
and it still is it is very very close to the book,positive
great i just wish i came across this earlier then i did,positive
sure this movie wasnt like etc but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us i found this movie really great and scary is real and the mind is a powerful thing i recommend to watch this movie its great and not bad directing at all they dont understand the film its plot its view,positive
this is a great flick he is probably my favorite character enjoyable no matter how small or old you are s needs a dvd release,positive
this is one of them this music video is not so much a music video but more or less a short horror film s music you need to see this video at least once,positive
its a film that has almost too much on its mind unfortunately all is not well i liked the film a great deal,positive
i enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if i could,positive
the little boy that plays his son was fantastic he made this a father son movie to remember i believe this movie will be a classic,positive
always makes me laugh and feel good when i watch this show the episodes start again when they end but dont play end credits until the very end but always play the opening credits,positive
if you have the chance view the film and enjoy it,positive
there are moments in the film that could have used some work but all in all not a bad time at the cinema,positive
it is also probably the best film youll see in the cinema this year,positive
i have heard that it will be released on dvd as well i hope that he finds her,positive
mr obviously it could happen a a both at once of course no movie is perfect,positive
this is one of them i like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about we are told that it gives hope but never why or how i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more,positive
and what a way to go it starts out real slow low light and bad acting like most b films,positive
this film plays really well with an audience this is an entertaining film,positive
i love his movies because he always plays his role very well,positive
i said not to mention it anyway when he goes political he still has something to say where does he go from here,positive
i love this movie it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while watching it i recommend this movie to everyone you will have a great time watching it,positive
how can this be true and what can we do to change it but we cant,positive
and of course there was the gore loved it go see it,positive
it was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world this kind of ending is something that hollywood would probably change if it was their script,positive
the score was amazing cant wait to see his next movie,positive
i went back many more times to see it over and over it was not around for years,positive
buy the video read the book go see the musical,positive
most children who like a good story will enjoy this the characters are played really well by a very good cast,positive
anyone know why i doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest,positive
the people we are about to meet are not nice guys it is at this point that dr,positive
is beyond me until and so she actually goes to see her,positive
i its hard to say maybe ill just say what comes to mind i couldnt believe it i dont feel that word often but i did while watching this movie will he is a great human being he is someone special happy i actually feel happy its a strange feeling i dont feel this way very often its just so nice to see to see other people really happy i mean really happy in this movie i did fun being yourself thats why i just loved the ending except on actually being happy i can understand that at least i think i can at least i enjoyed seeing them happy really happy women and men it seems to make life i dont really know but i felt something watching this movie thats the kind of movie this is its funny it made me think that maybe just maybe life is truly is a wonderful thing want to laugh want to feel really good you will get it all go will you are a great human being,positive
to my surprise it actually wasnt half bad the acting was decent and the story was nothing new of course but we all know that,positive
great story and characters however it is worth the rent,positive
the cast in this movie was real good to watch every role that she has ever played has been very good if you get a chance to see this movie you should,positive
all in all an excellent movie the best thing i take from it is hope,positive
was it really the best movie of all time ok i know thats silly to say but i did re watch the film,positive
this is one of those movies thats difficult to review without giving away the plot,positive
i can remember this movie from when i was a small child i loved it then and i still do now,positive
the book like the movie is called the good earth,positive
its an amazing thing i really like this film a great deal,positive
so well written good job to this girl i cant wait to see more,positive
shes really really funny one of the few shows i make point of watching i really cant wait until the next show something i havent felt for any show in a long time,positive
i was a huge fan of this series maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her i would highly recommend this series for watching on dvd,positive
thats all in the end this movie is one of a kind,positive
much better than i thought the ending was great too for a change not all bad guys are bad,positive
re see i think i can tell she does i say i think very i was that age but have no idea what i myself looked like then,positive
i wouldnt want to see this movie but after watching it i couldnt say it was bad just not my kind of film,positive
i could not really feel sorry for these two they really did nothing for the film and were totally ridiculous i felt good i actually wanted to be a part of this family they were so realistic,positive
really its just a story a very weird one i admit but after all only a weird story,positive
sure its just an action flick but isnt having fun what watching movies is all about if you want fun watch this film,positive
overall if you want a stupid fun b movie this one should do the job,positive
this is a classic war movie i cant picture anyone better for the role,positive
than it all goes wrong especially because this isnt actually a bad movie i had a nice time watching it and overall i enjoyed the movie,positive
this is probably one of the worst movies ever made its terrible but its so good,positive
good sequel to murder in a small town go see it,positive
i have to admit that over the years i have watched many of his films and find his best work really high quality s a it works in the film but it would have been better if the song was more memorable,positive
youve done it before the real star of this movie is new york,positive
she gives in some day see ending each star has a great moment a bad man clearly no at least not this year too bad,positive
if you can find any type of copy of this buy or rent it,positive
it has a great story interesting characters and some of the best animation ive seen it also has some great japanese music in it too if you havent seen this series yet check it out,positive
but you cant really understand this movie without seeing it,positive
but a person cant do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress she just keeps getting better and better,positive
this film is too good for words i think you just get so loved up with the characters and their life style it doesnt have a particular story line to it you have to get this movie on dvd never mind just watching it you have to have it,positive
there is no way that you cant have a good time playing this game i loved it overall score out of,positive
there is nothing wrong with it at all id of killed them also,positive
okay lets face it this is a god awful movie the plot such as it is is horrible the acting worse that alone is worth watching the movie,positive
however it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever,positive
well i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie,positive
if you havent seen this see it and then buy it,positive
they just didnt use it how oh well even those little things cant really put this game down,positive
but ill save that story for later it is a great film,positive
im happy with that as a big fan of horror and i liked most of those new horror films,positive
how about fighting well this movie has both of those yes,positive
that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen you should know already whether youre the sort of person whos going to like this sort of film,positive
particularly as you are having such a great time working in tv all made for tv,positive
the acting is on a high level definitely worth seeing,positive
man this is scary watch the movie i know it doesnt sound any special but it is scary rent this movie it is good,positive
well how could they still this video is more than just the music i b got its name right in the middle of it one on top of the other i doubt,positive
people must learn to watch what is up there on the screen,positive
it is a simple story of a couple as i said but it is not boring it just show a couple should be everything known it is but i am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen so dont forget to watch the end,positive
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see the film works best on a big screen,positive
none that have ever been made even come close to it also the film had good direction and was extremely well acted,positive
for the budget that this movie was filmed on the music was particularly amazing,positive
i have seen the perfect son about three times i highly recommend the film,positive
even today when it comes on t what an actor,positive
this movie really surprised me the storyline is somewhat hard to follow sometimes but in the end i think it made everything better as for the acting i think it was good,positive
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen else a fantastic movie i hope people will enjoy it,positive
although this film was absolutely fantastic you cannot say that you have seen it if you havent seen the last scene period the actors will always have this superb film in their career,positive
the acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts excellent cast it was all great,positive
and the ending by the way where is the sequel the budget is obviously extremely low but look what they did with it why the acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them what was going on in that scene now as for the plot mostly it is good why it just happens just weird again i would have liked to have known some of these characters better what can i say,positive
as a big horror movie fan i highly recommend this film,positive
i think it is a nice little comedy and really funny but its their problem not of the film,positive
i enjoyed the movie very much i like the actors in this film after all i do love this kind of movie,positive
the father was creepy and played perfectly the animation was superb i just cant say enough about how wonderful this episode was so much is said with so few words or the rest of the series for that matter,positive
youll feel like youre in the middle of the situation,positive
the end of his american career would have meant the end of mr,positive
i hope that this show will last long either way it was funny as hell,positive
overall police story is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever made,positive
im not saying that bad things didnt happen it all gets its part in this movie,positive
i enjoyed that film as well the actors all did a wonderful job the story was well written good entertainment,positive
first rate acting first rate direction first rate sets and effects take it from a guy who knows his movies,positive
fire comes next with earth close behind in order of quality ill believe it when i see it,positive
the script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama his moment of truth is very moving,positive
id go see them see it if for no other reason than to hear some good music,positive
still the movies not at all bad just slow moving,positive
it brings back happy times for me the music was great in this movie,positive
well then youre probably not watching this movie anyway its a very enjoyable film one well worth taking the time to see,positive
in fact the crew are almost the same the cast indeed there is some truth in it and now only sex but is it the only thing love is based on,positive
everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality,positive
not so classic they were so romantic its worth it,positive
the final action sequence is one of the best i have ever seen in any film,positive
its entertaining to say the least it has a lot of great humor in it so it makes me laugh as well the whole cast is what i would say perfect for this movie dont miss it,positive
a film that everyone must see does anyone know if there will be one keep up the good work i loved it,positive
a really cool flick just watch this film and enjoy,positive
what a movie but this movie it is such a great movie with a such original script and so good direction and so well acting,positive
to my surprise to die for is a really good movie,positive
i have not once seen it on tv before in my country and a lot of people do not usually know about this show once you begin watching you are probably going to watch it to the end,positive
all in all a brilliant film and a brilliant story,positive
we all have friends some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with people that you can say are like your brother or sister you can see that from the beginning but first i want to say what is good about the film the other thing that i had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film i wont say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself youll know what i am talking about but i didnt get that here overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question how far would you go for a friend lets just hope that it never comes down to that,positive
i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hard im definitely going to re get this on dvd because i have to see the special features its very funny how that happens you can find that in this film he gave a strong comic performance i highly recommend it,positive
it is very fast and funny they all gives over the top performances,positive
it is an excellent film it is an experience one must view for themselves lots of character,positive
why has this not been released how wrong can a girl be it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch and how far away from this are we really,positive
there is no plot as such in short they wanted out and they were going to say a few things before they left yes they had plenty of help they were fun and just a little bit crazy enjoy,positive
what the right role can do for you he makes and excellent romantic lead a good cast a good movie,positive
one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time i have heard it said too often that there are no new stories to tell,positive
but the movie isnt perfect still sometimes it seems as if the story doesnt really know where it wants to go,positive
also best seen with someone else or if you know someone else that has seen it you will want to talk about it,positive
the action scenes are excellent and its almost like die hard except its set in a school the direction is very good there is a bit of blood and violence the acting is fantastic he is one of my favorite actors rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one,positive
who knew they could be so funny well worth your time,positive
im not sure whether i like this film or not i think it is creepy and completely weird i think his performance was really good and one of his best but i dont like the character at all over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real i would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didnt end how i expected it to if you are into creepy weird and really well different movies go for this one,positive
good film with a great supporting cast well worth watching,positive
there is no such a thing as perfect murder but he could each and every one of them back for one more question,positive
i really like this film i thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now i would have loved it to turn out a little different,positive
no not at all amazing buy this youll love it,positive
once you have seen this film like me you may want to see it again four stars out of five for me,positive
this movie is simply amazing but for the rest s,positive
the jokes have been done its all over wrong and this game has the best joke of the whole series,positive
i enjoyed this movie but it was far from a masterpiece,positive
so i really cant see whats wrong with this movie so give it a try,positive
she just cant stay away from fighting but that is not at all what this is about that way you can deal with more problems at once,positive
from here the story gets interesting the point for me of this film became something other than what i thought it would its a horror style play thats been filmed if you can enjoy such a thing this is a masterpiece it has good writing good acting and good direction,positive
of course there is a problem please please will someone cast him as a hero in the genre,positive
ok its not an in your face hilarious title but then its not an in your face hilarious film please give british films like this a chance,positive
hes just a personal favorite i cant say that same however for his films unfortunately it didnt last but just wait a while,positive
is it a black comedy an action a thriller movie anyway i found it an enjoyable movie,positive
i got this movie so i could make fun of it instead it was going to try its best to be a good movie and you know what yes it could have been better id love to see what they do next,positive
i saw this film at school and absolutely loved it seriously i couldnt find anything wrong with it,positive
i always wonder if it will not be quite the same but i am never disappointed in it there is much to enjoy old movies can be good movies,positive
and its great you cant rate this along other movies its in a class of its own,positive
that is funny stuff in my book then came the second season lets get back to that,positive
check her out in other things you would be surprised,positive
acting is done well and the town setting itself seems wrong with to begin with,positive
sure this movie take some age but the idea behind the movie is actual again since writing all stop if you like reality show this movie is not for you if you dont like ask yourself question about now and future well never look this movie,positive
and thats the problem with this film it should have been set in the era it was written in,positive
its by no means perfect but its entertaining and doesnt try to be anything other than that,positive
this movie from what i remember was such a great movie but we did remember almost the entire movie and i do believe i only watched it once i would so love to see it again,positive
i was just a bit young for this one but i had to see it,positive
but not everyone is happy with the situation of course they are the us watch the movie and find out,positive
this was not so this was not so this was not so i see now that the movie works extremely well its much more of a human drama i hope we see much more of it in the sequel,positive
a movie that made non fans fans take it or leave it he takes himself way to serious,positive
the two boys were well boys what else can you say did i say that more simply put,positive
however i enjoyed this movie if you are expecting to see a great romance this is not it,positive
why so why isnt this movie out on dvd get with it people,positive
i must say this is the best comedy i have ever seen i love the movie because it makes me feel real i felt lost as a comedy it does its job perfectly,positive
i think its a great idea if you follow any of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list,positive
this was a great movie we hope you like as much as we did,positive
and who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out,positive
just saw the movie its actually pretty good the women and the music are beautiful,positive
see it if you have the chance its well worth the time,positive
it makes no sense i tell you im surprised that this one never got a sequel but i guess it simply came out too late,positive
i really like the show like i said love love love it,positive
this movie is all about entertainment thats what this film is about a job well done i thought it was a great film,positive
many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white,positive
i kept trying to remember where i knew him from and just looked it up,positive
sci fi on tv is difficult there are so many problems that the genre brings with it not completely but more so than most also the tv feeling is very present much of the time good enough to want another season without a doubt,positive
i would recommend this movie for every one the actors did a great job of acting and the movie was very well played and done,positive
at three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half,positive
or maybe not to do all that takes real talent something mr of course not dont believe that why not pretty enough maybe or maybe not,positive
people got high in there each time was more hilarious than the last to get this joke you must watch the video,positive
this film is a little film and it was entertaining at least thats the way i saw it enjoy it for what it is a small entertaining film,positive
the actors and the direction of this film are both good,positive
he doesnt get it it just doesnt matter it just doesnt matter i mean this stuff is classic disappointed with the dvd though maybe not my life,positive
in any case we can now watch our favorite series over and over again,positive
i will not comment on the story as such the movie is worth watching for that shot alone great stuff,positive
a wonderful movie you will enjoy this movie we need more like it,positive
forget all those people who tell you its not as good as the book so what this is a film after all,positive
because his characters are loved and ask to be loved,positive
why you should see it this is a tale sad sometimes dark but a tale i love this film,positive
why did they make them so big why didnt they just give the money to the poor it didnt start out that way but it turns out to be so much more,positive
you never know it could happen he was hilarious you will like or love it out of,positive
somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending,positive
now ive see many of them this episode was down right creepy as hell,positive
i like many things about the film to me this is a very fine film about what it is to be human,positive
in fact i havent seen it on the tv either since the day i watched it a,positive
it deserves the success it had and theres even more success to come with its re release,positive
watching it in the theater i was surprised how many older people were there to watch it however when you are at the movie just remember this movie is all in good humor the jokes arent gay jokes theyre just jokes and theyre funny,positive
i thought the movie was actually pretty good and the boy who played the child,positive
everyone who has read the book knows that will happen anyway,positive
the suspense here is very real without going over the top into scary movie stuff this is a shame since she was very good way back then i will recommend are you in the house alone,positive
there are lots of laughs all around its also nice to see a short like this because the boys arent exactly the characters we know and love,positive
in short i thought this was an incredibly moving story,positive
a surprise emotional ending what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more,positive
at his best when telling stories from a kids point of view,positive
i used to watch this all the time as a kid and i still sometimes watch it,positive
i am someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a series fan,positive
its a very good comedy movie i dont know why i love this movie i just love it good music good direction good story and screenplay and very good comedy,positive
i want to read as much as i can about him but i am not surprised i like all his movies whether he is acting or directing,positive
i just do not see what is so bad about this movie i loved this movie i thought this movie was the best film in the series those who like a little bit of drama because wait i wont tell you you will just have to watch it well i guess that is all i have to say about this movie,positive
for the most part i love this movie go i havent read the book but i hope to one of these days,positive
what i thought before really isnt worth getting into its still working inside me its not worth the writing space to go into why i would not let myself before but i see now the worth in making art like this to make people or perhaps to make people do something light,positive
this movie is also great as its dialogue is good,positive
overall an excellent movie worth the watch even if once,positive
really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen sometimes things turn out good sometimes they turn out bad and such is life i highly recommend this movie,positive
i did not watch his other movies they came and went seems real,positive
the movie is very realistic not everything happens the way we think it should happen i can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note,positive
pretty obvious but so what that guy is funny this is a movie that i would buy when it comes out on dvd its fun fast and entertaining,positive
well the movie did turn out a lot better than i expected its really not a silly romantic comedy its worth a watch at the end of it all you actually see yourself going through it all the movie makes you feel something you may even learn a thing or two,positive
the only thing it needed was a follow up at the end to tell where these people are today theres no hope for any of them,positive
i certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again,positive
i thought better of him and think less of him for this movie,positive
then you must see this film to understand the reality,positive
this is of course my personal opinion the voice work on the other hand is quite good,positive
as an audience we dont want to sit through the same old story again,positive
still he tries his best to get her to love him,positive
thats the way it is in real life just the same hes too nice for his own good dont get me wrong its not all sad its a good laugh as well,positive
what a man among men all in the same episode,positive
this was the best documentary ive seen a must see ever see a man save his own life amazing to watch,positive
this movie is a great film this is the movie that you watch by yourself or with someone else,positive
even my brother no matter how funny some movies are even if i think its funny i sometimes cant seem to laugh but this movie,positive
whatever it is this game never seems to get old no matter how many times ive played it,positive
if you are but a dream and the song written for the film the house i live in,positive
this story has been done so many times in various ways there is not much action but there are some very hot sex scenes see this as you may like it more than i did,positive
the production and sets also were much better than i expected,positive
the music in the film is really nice too brilliant,positive
it was so well made well written well acted well directed etc everything about it was wonderful it actually makes sense coming soon,positive
i loved so much as a child i had to find it for my daughter it is definitely a movie i would watch with kids i think all kids should see it and would enjoy it,positive
if no one has seen the movies these are the best of the best,positive
the movie is excellent dont want to give away too much,positive
this is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh please sit back and enjoy this movie people its a good one,positive
i hope that everyone gets to see this wonderful movie and enjoy it as i did,positive
here you are already able to know the two main characters,positive
well i have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film beautiful film,positive
but if you are crazy about that sort of films i believe that you can find it,positive
i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor at times we can tell that everyone has had it,positive
if you want to watch this its not about the fighting really,positive
although the plot sounds serious the film is anything but this is done well by all throughout,positive
overall the movie is hilarious and i wish that it were shown more often,positive
all in all this is by far my least favorite of the four,positive
this film is hilarious brilliant comedy but only because of one actor the best comedy actor i have ever seen its something special about him he is just so funny,positive
there is a fact about this movie definitely true a first rate film,positive
maybe its because i saw the movie before reading the book but i really love this movie ive seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more,positive
i have just watched this movie for the first time today and just loved it,positive
i loved this show anyone know where she is now i wish they would put it out on dvd,positive
first what i didnt like ive got to say one more thing though,positive
this was better than the first show not this time good work,positive
i especially liked the ending of this movie i really felt what the characters must have felt which i think is a mark of good directing,positive
a surprise emotional ending what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more,positive
what is it were never told why were not told why,positive
other actors acted pretty well too though the acting isnt important in this type of movies,positive
i cant tell you how many times ive watched this movie how many times i have enjoyed it and how often i wish that more people could see it,positive
i loved this movie great storyline and actors and good movie sets i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack i think this is some of his best work his past movies were ok but this one really told a story for a change,positive
thats so stupid youll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible her air time in the film was pretty short though,positive
it is she who will have the last laugh maybe,positive
the rest of the cast was very good as well,positive
ive enjoyed this movie ever since i was a kid and i still do,positive
this is a great example of that in this movie its romance comedy and drama and its well done,positive
i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent,positive
i am surprised so few have good words for this movie story was good,positive
but thats just me the movie is deep and at the same time very light,positive
what a great film it is their romance is very enjoyable,positive
i saw this movie when i was very young it is my all time favorite,positive
peter was an actor who made his own father laugh and peter certainly made me laugh in this movie you couldnt tell a story any better than it is told here,positive
i enjoyed this film this is definitely a unique film and not crap,positive
theres one particular scene i could watch over and over and i have id recommend this film to anyone,positive
this is one of my favorite t i cant begin to tell you how much i love mr this is one of my favorite t mr,positive
i thought this movie was pretty good i would tell my other friends to watch this movie,positive
i found this show really late at night and gave it a try i hope everyone gives it a shot,positive
but it is really strong might make you feel different,positive
i saw this film without to know what about were,positive
thats when the real action begins great movie great performances and lots of laughs,positive
their t s history head really has no plot show,positive
in battle i would rate it more of a drama than action,positive
all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done i hope for a sequel very soon,positive
oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie,positive
but shes not what she seems or is she i couldnt quite figure it out let me give an example okay really yes really i dont know should you see it by all means,positive
since then we have been trying to find a copy,positive
it was not the best of all movies but it was good enough the plot line was not very believable but the script was well written overall the film was good but not great,positive
the twist is so much fun i highly recommend this film,positive
it never lets you rest just one thing after another the soundtrack is great the songs are the right ones for the scenes this is not always the case,positive
i watched it not really expecting much from an obviously low budget production,positive
i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie,positive
so something went wrong with this one but still its very entertaining,positive
she wants to box not looked down upon because she is a woman great movie,positive
i think this movie has got it all it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head it has cool looking characters on that part i kept saying remember remember i loved that part although it has been a while since i saw it so i dont remember that part although there was some bad things in all it was a great movie i wish i had that movie,positive
eventually they have sex but no one is forced into it the ending of the movie has paul in good chance of being found out if you dont like the ending of a movie think one up yourself,positive
this was absolutely one of the best movies ive seen i couldnt help but care about the characters take the time to watch it,positive
im still thinking about this one the next day which doesnt happen often a great film,positive
you really want to know how things are going to work out where are they now mr,positive
even if you dont its a good movie with some interesting character development and no its not just a song,positive
this film was great it was on the whole very good,positive
where do i begin there are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say oh my no way i loved every minute of it it was so hilarious that they had to put it in anyway incredibly funny do not miss out,positive
dialog and acting are great but thats not the point although nothing ever really happens the movie never gets boring even if you dont like love stories you should watch this film the first part is perfect as it is in my opinion,positive
this movie will not sit well with some but it is a must view whos got a problem now and with whom around them why but overall this film is about people again not for everyone,positive
i for one miss them but this is a serious movie youre going to the movies,positive
the cast sometimes is not more than average the bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand what the characters are saying,positive
i absolutely love this show but i saw the second episode first after watching the first episode i could see why people were turned off at first,positive
its well made and entertaining but its not as interesting as it should have been the screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down the acting is also very good,positive
this is my favorite all time movie they get in a huge fight everyone has their im sure i love this movie i love him too,positive
although this was obviously a low budget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing,positive
i enjoyed watching this movie at home but i wont watch it a second time but then again its an ok kind of movie,positive
going into this movie i knew two things about it there isnt an actual story try and guess what happens wrong the gore effects in this one were great for myself ill have to view this a couple times to understand whats truly being said give it a try the next line im about to say has been used in almost every review ive read for this film this movie is not for everyone check this out,positive
i cant tell if the acting was bad it didnt seem to me,positive
have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly i think the whole film is just fun back in the old days,positive
even if your not a huge fan of him id still recommend this one,positive
where can someone else see this work the character development is amazing,positive
sure you can see where this movie is going but you dont care,positive
now i am a little bit disappointed about the story stupid because before this character wasnt that stupid cheap and simple also too simple and then no and more,positive
the story is something that really keeps you watching this makes for a great film that i wish i had come up with first,positive
and let me tell you this is not the sort of movie that you find every day and i sure didnt see that end scene coming but of course theres a lot more to it than that,positive
we all had fun working on this show and i think that fun comes through,positive
no wonder why thats the only reason i wanted to see this and it didnt let me down,positive
if not i will have to rent the movie this was a great movie,positive
i dont think so what a great face that man has,positive
talk to someone and let them know you love them love does no good unless it is given to another,positive
i cant tell you all how much i love this movie,positive
s version s and the many scenes not seen in the american version add little or nothing to the final problem s version though s s version s and the opening credits on the dvd is terrible s version i love this film its also the best zombie movie ever t s,positive
this is one of those movies that you just dont want to end i couldnt believe this was a made for television film s,positive
well the movie isnt exactly funny the plot and acting are pretty good,positive
while im on the subject it is really the over direction of this movie that brings it down,positive
this is fairly realistic and yes even scary well worth seeing but just hope nothing like this ever really happens,positive
i liked this movie well acted and good enough plot,positive
is this a good movie not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie of course at times of course the movie is very silly but it has its moments,positive
one of the best real life movies ive ever seen,positive
you cant do it he really made you think again making perfect sense,positive
perhaps personal perhaps not working long hours with short pay,positive
the film is in part a musical all of the songs are new material and many of them are classic,positive
its very funny it has a great cast who each give great performances,positive
it is always different because i am always at a different stage of life yet i would not want to miss a single note and this is simply the best movie ever,positive
i couldnt believe it was the same guy as house,positive
he is the kind of strange character that you cant make up quite easily he is often alone and used to it the character of mr mr,positive
acting was better than average for a low budget film excellent work keep it up,positive
in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at,positive
one ends up giving up it wouldnt work in any other hands in fact they worked just great some say that this is his best film,positive
ten years later its like watching it all again for the first time all in all this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of i,positive
in my opinion this is not a great film because of the effects it has to do with the story the atmosphere and of course the acting,positive
i loved this movie the acting was of course wonderful,positive
there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd and this is one of them,positive
great little thriller but not this one also one last comment,positive
its also the best book ive ever read she just liked playing with him,positive
everyone always enjoyed it its actually a great movie for kids too,positive
well the truth is most of us can and do do that all the time,positive
how typical this was a very good movie she also got an oscar and thats what you should do what was it about sex that makes a good parents actually thats how they have the child but seriously hes right good movie,positive
there are so many funny lines even years later i remember this movie well i highly recommend this film,positive
most of the time camera doesnt move but people move around it great movie,positive
and the special effects too but please keep in mind that this was not a big budget film okay b nothing that would in my opinion waste your time i think this was a good movie if weak at some points,positive
and it turned out to be quite a good little horror surprise,positive
of course it did but theres more to the film than that in the end though it is also about that song,positive
there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well sure its not all that well done but the premise is not at all bad tom,positive
the only over the top performance comes from a guy whos supposed to be crazy anyway so thats expected see it now,positive
none but these little things take nothing away from this classic ive only seen this done in a few films,positive
but dont give up so quickly anyway romance of their own soon takes a turn much for the better basically he doesnt know what to make of things,positive
better than this game well the story is perfect its like you are in the movie itself just like in the movie,positive
this is an entertaining movie how scary is that but before that nice guy,positive
this is a cool funny family comedy series enjoyable to everyone and you will definitely enjoy it i did still funny,positive
if you loved deep cover you might like this film as well amazing film good work,positive
the music in it is great any true hard rock fan should see this movie and buy the soundtrack,positive
but something seems wrong the girls leave but the boys stay behind,positive
brilliant after seeing the film i can understand why there was such a long line,positive
however ive never seen any of his movies well it was i havent seen any of his other movies i also loved the music for this movie thats when you know you have a great score it really is an amazing piece of work,positive
yes the make up is not greatest youll ever see but what the hell i still love this movie,positive
at times this movie seemed like a documentary because you didnt know whether or not these were real events taking place,positive
s but some other parts of the world i enjoyed how mr,positive
this movie isnt as bad as i heard i enjoyed it,positive
wonderful but except from that its one of the best movies ever ten out of ten,positive
go see this one youll find it hilarious go check it out and thats ok,positive
he falls in love with her it is hard to tell actually that isnt even true she says she doesnt care what others think for her sex and love are one and the same we dont need to see any more hollywood could never make a movie like this you wont forget her or the character she brings to life,positive
its a really good and funny film so dont miss it,positive
this is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this you will not be disappointed,positive
know what youre getting into before you sit down to watch it and youll be fine not for everyone but a very good drama and overall a very good film,positive
this movie is just a lot of fun ive seen it a couple of times but it always has something funny that i remember there are so many running jokes that its amazing,positive
never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment the writing was excellent,positive
and if you dont like the first movie or the tv show,positive
it gets better as it goes on though a predictable end two which were really cool,positive
i cannot hate on the show sorry this is whats great about the show,positive
the whole idea made me think about our society it was excellent,positive
i must admit to those that havent seen it you will either really love it or really hate it what did you expect,positive
where are you now i doubt that why would you doubt that its all about the action,positive
i was not in the least disappointed and id definitely recommend this,positive
it was the greatest show ever but i wish it would come back and make more episodes please come back the show was absolutely hilarious you couldnt laugh without seeing an episode those were the best episodes it will be and always will be the best show ever they should make new episodes,positive
this is a very good story for anyone young or old who has ever been in love or ever wanted to be does he ever get his wish watch it and see,positive
if there is such a thing as beautiful horror this film is one of the best in this genre,positive
when the movie first started i thought cheesy the first ten minutes were really boring the plot was different than anything i had ever seen now was it a horror not really the good side was that the movie was very entertaining too bad hollywood didnt put more money behind this,positive
in a word and so incredibly real the script so real,positive
i really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more will be watching again for sure check it out,positive
not always that good but as good as she can,positive
i know that doesnt make much sense but thats what happened,positive
or will they kill each other first any gun can play should not be taken too seriously,positive
however it surprised me how close can it be to any human while i watch it,positive
this is what i call a great movie there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic,positive
b b indeed this is strange i take the view that if you are going to put history on television get it right s i say time to stop this review,positive
i wasnt sure what to think of the movie not too much of a kids film right until the end of the movie but i do recommend the movie even for a sequel,positive
i watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it,positive
if this is the first youve heard about it dont leave it like i did,positive
so what does one expect that list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously the actor who played the old man was actually very good,positive
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl if you ask me it was a good show also the writing was very strong,positive
the film though is interesting but in something quite different of course that does not save the film but at least that makes it worth watching,positive
from a film making point of view its not great the ending though i liked the idea they were going for was fairly poorly done,positive
i think my father did that to me anyway and im the better man for it kill kill kill,positive
s will they be able to do it silly premise but the film actually works in other words fun still i enjoyed it a lot,positive
why do we the audience want to like him so much,positive
together they make a great team and work well together i have seen both of the ones that have been shown will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together,positive
very realistic with great dialogue i thought it was great great very good it was well done,positive
anyone know anything about this film and whether it may be released,positive
first time if you see it youll know what i mean watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it,positive
why living with her must have been extremely difficult it is her show she was not a nice woman,positive
of course its stupid thats the point you have to see the movie dr s,positive
those two played well off each other oh well still well worth it any guy will love this flick check it out,positive
the soundtrack is excellent did i mention that the soundtrack was good lets see what else can i say it wasnt too long,positive
i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining good characters good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout,positive
it is definitely one of the most unique films ever made it goes on and on with strange scenes thats not to say i enjoyed everything,positive
my wife went with me to see the film and she did not know a thing about it before hand and we had a great time,positive
i liked this short it is not one of their best but some moments are hilarious though,positive
when i first saw it i was feeling good all over for days please,positive
rather its a film in which they act as real as it can be,positive
maybe its just me which i do believe was the reason this powerful story was told,positive
the music is also brilliant very dramatic when it needs to be not only did i love this but this is quite possibly the best documentary i have ever seen,positive
theme song written by b well written well acted and totally classic,positive
first of all ive got to give it to the people that got this thing together that being said i think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments,positive
the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun this is great family fun,positive
i must admit at first i wasnt expecting anything good at all i would definitely recommend it to everyone,positive
and its still not at the top of my list,positive
after watching this movie in my opinion is definitely worth seeing to say the least in short it is a well acted well directed movie if you find you know everything there is to know about the world you wont find it here but if you do watch it you just might find something in yourself,positive
what a great movie definitely a must see for drama fans,positive
you cant thats not the case here i liked it so much that right after the end credits i watched it a second time i do love you please,positive
ive seen this directors other movies before they need to show life as it is,positive
this is an excellent film everyone should see especially children,positive
she is hot hot hot and some of the girls too,positive
this movie is a masterpiece go see it theres nothing more to say,positive
but they are doing so with style give it a watch you wont be disappointed,positive
she might not appear all that much but when she does,positive
i must say i thought i had seen it all im way past that point never never never ever ever but there you go he did it oh well i would definitely recommend this film,positive
its hilarious if that wasnt enough the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldnt possibly be better,positive
it has everything you could want and how better to get it,positive
this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release,positive
i watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time until the very last minute i did not know how it would turn out i could not do that with this film,positive
i loved it i thought all of the actors played their parts very well and hope more people get to see the movie i highly recommend it,positive
i like money wasnt sure what to expect im making all my friends watch this movie everyone i know watch this movie then once youre done read more write more think more,positive
i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie,positive
if that sounds crazy its because it is right where was i okay i was trying not to run out of space but what an actress okay how do i get back,positive
the directing was pretty good not a film that needed to be over directed what really makes this film stand out i think is the writing,positive
it was so great she said the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i ok i thought ill give it a look see i didnt want to like it and i didnt i loved it what a great movie where to start first the directing then the performances they had their rich girl poor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought then the song problems this is truly an excellent movie,positive
i do and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t and i remember almost every scene that was in the add,positive
see it now its definitely in my top ten its one of the best parts or when mr,positive
makes me feel like i am there again too bad they dont make a sequel,positive
she was probably thinking more about the child than the show there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show,positive
it has its problems what movies dont but still its enjoyable i know so many people who dont like this movie and im not saying i dont see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isnt it enjoyable and moving,positive
a really great movie and true story this picture is well worth the time i wish they would make more films of this quality,positive
a great flick with lots of laughs i dont usually go for those feel good movies but i really enjoyed this one,positive
however in order to get the money he needs a american name star,positive
i love it this is some funny stuff really funny and along the way you will laugh thats all there is enjoy,positive
i wonder if this was to save money and the music,positive
then again what do i know im only a child,positive
the movie itself was ok for the kids he makes the movie all by himself hes the reason ive just love this movie,positive
and maybe one of the best films of all times telling story characters atmosphere is wonderful tells about you tells about me tells about us,positive
an excellent cast all of who gave good performances back to the movie,positive
just my opinion so this film isnt for a world audience,positive
the dialog the characters the whole script is near perfect if you like comedy who doesnt than youll like this,positive
she kept looking for the english soundtrack all in all the film wasnt bad in fact the whole film will,positive
she falls in love with it right away this is a movie you will enjoy for years to come one side note,positive
she didnt get the oscar the top three stars didnt really need much script i would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue im not giving away much of the story because i hate it when i know what happens before i see it for myself,positive
would i see it in a theater sure i did when it first came out its funny that should be enough i cant think of any at least not in hollywood its one of those fun to watch movies,positive
the relationship between the wife and husband is unique nothing and no one can come between the two of them,positive
the two lead roles did an excellent job acting i mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister but everyone did a fine job there is a lot going on between the lines in this film,positive
and to my american friends it will break you up also brilliant tv how tv should be,positive
this is one of the first films i can remember or maybe the first one,positive
its funny when he doesnt make sense thats something i pay attention to a lot,positive
it is a series to watch with your children over and over again,positive
the animation was very good the music i think thats where this movie fails the story was fun i enjoyed the film but thats because im a fan,positive
i doubt its ever been done better this is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film,positive
oh well if you do you really wont enjoy the movie its not easy as it looks,positive
but i absolutely loved it this one makes it worth the effort,positive
you just have to pay attention to what is going on in the film but the ending made up for the entire film and for that and the very last scene this is one of my favorite movies ever this film is interesting to say the least but if you are not watching this for the performances that the actors give id say you better let this one go because that is all that keeps this certain film together,positive
so just understand that this is a totally silly movie and you wont be a bit disappointed i liked it anyway,positive
not quite human is a very good series of films to watch if you can ever find these movies again,positive
im not sure if ive never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it i have many other ones that i like too,positive
its a time that people wont soon forget anyway this movie is one that i definitely recommend,positive
he was true to himself but thought about his audience,positive
this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made,positive
this is the greatest movie ever if you have written it off with out ever seeing it you must give it a second try,positive
we were told all this right at the start of the movie,positive
i read the back and knew right away it was going to either be the best or the worst movie i have ever seen but it doesnt take away from the movie,positive
this is such a great movie to watch with young children,positive
you dont need a reason all you need is a gun,positive
i love it its humor and hes not like everyone else the movie is great i love the story line and most of the people in the movie its funny from the first time she meets him at school only the people you want to see are left in the end she finally makes it,positive
what a home run let me tell you man i wish i could go back to that time i hate it,positive
i think this is a great movie much better than the original its no drama but a movie that makes you feel it has a good soundtrack and overall a good sorry a good end to the series,positive
i didnt know what to expect id not read much about it as i knew i would see it no matter what all in all it is very well done,positive
watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience,positive
every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love a film where you see people you know portrayed on screen its cinema very at its best,positive
i didnt now what to expect from this movie so they try something else anyway i can tell you the rest of the film documentary but you must see this one with youre own eyes see you,positive
definitely a feel good movie see it you wont be disappointed,positive
in any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much,positive
i wasnt disappointed get some interesting shots felt like they wanted to get the series over with though i thought that was going to be it look at what they make you give the final scene was great why would he do that that didnt make sense,positive
the animation itself is of course pretty good its pretty cool i just love them overall this is an okay movie but its ending is quite bad the ending however is weak,positive
if you think youre into this kind of thing then go if not dont,positive
why is this film so good why we never know,positive
them too some come close but none of them are quite this good,positive
but seriously what this movie is all about is chance this movie is also very sad at times overall its a wonderful family movie if you enjoyed this movie youll probably enjoy the sequel too,positive
and i still thought it was pretty good and ive just watched it its really kind of weird but a good weird a classic french film word for word,positive
what can i say about the first film ever you cant rate this because its not supposed to be entertaining this was one of the most important movies in history i wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever,positive
family guy is the best show on tv ever there are some good ones i let me tell you what makes family guy so funny,positive
but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect,positive
this movie was better than i expected i found this movie entertaining and i enjoyed it,positive
where one episode ends the next begins the acting is amazing as that of the first or at least just under like the first four episodes the ones the first part had and more as the first the humor just takes up too much space and this time around its even worse three of them no less no you read that right most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable though,positive
youll want to watch this film more than once and each time mr,positive
if anyone has any ideas id like to hear what they might be very much worth seeing,positive
even without their talk i am now a fan of the new show i loved it it was really very good it has a strong and rich story and kept my interest i sure couldnt tell in this film she was sort of on the side but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on,positive
this movie without doubt is the best i have seen and really shows what british talent can do,positive
i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it was so interesting and moving the director writer and actors did an amazing job it was great drama mystery and more i think that the director writer should write more movies like this one i loved it i didnt even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see,positive
when i saw the movie i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies and i was right,positive
this is a truly hilarious film and one that i have seen many times,positive
it is very good the monster towards the end is very scary,positive
everything you need for an entertaining monster movie other than that i can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there,positive
it happened anyway it would work for the audience to be part of a film,positive
the next day i kept thinking about the movie though but theres a lot of laughs in this picture,positive
sure it was well shot and made very well shot and made but the story was just so weak i mean who the hell was he supposed to be how am i supposed to take this seriously i mean come on that was just stupid,positive
not one everything works these are just real girls trying to find themselves i cant wait to see what mr,positive
so i decided to watch it i had the time and interest to watch it as a general comment so do what you can to take the time to check out this movie i can almost be sure it wont be a waste of time,positive
this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made,positive
i have read these reviews on here a few times it has some bad acting so does half the movies made there is much much worse out there than this fun movie if you hate this film so much dont buy it there are bad reviews and good reviews and i dont mind those i give both bad and good reviews myself sad one called this film boring well love it or hate it one thing you can never say about this film is that it is boring love it or hate it give it a real review or type nothing it is obvious you have not seen the films,positive
thats not to say it isnt a good movie but its not a masterpiece,positive
and if you didnt you have serious problems once again great movie,positive
but this movie is indeed different yes i may be getting old but ive seen a lot go see it,positive
now i went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie and i was right as almost every horror flick i have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most thats all,positive
i watch it every year it is fun from beginning to end,positive
the movie not only has lots of humor it also has a good message for life,positive
the second part was to have been the original film and was written first and i think shot first,positive
that is to say as much as i loved this film it wasnt perfect,positive
anyway this was one of my favorite movies as a young child the story line is interesting and the songs are great good acting and not over the top,positive
then no wonder that the guys fall for her how could i forget him mr,positive
maybe thats why his performance was good and coming need i say more,positive
that it is its not a perfect movie by any means,positive
does he ever have relationship with them and with this film the director makes us too,positive
obviously yes i cant believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book and this something was the most important part,positive
theres never a moment when you think oh im watching a movie and shes an actress,positive
the story starts its so cool amazing wait and see,positive
thats pretty bad really so what if it is they were both excellent movies,positive
the story is just fantastic its so original and so entertaining what comes to acting well the movie doesnt even go wrong there,positive
you live every second every feeling he does well you just dont believe him the role many people will probably hate this movie say its boring,positive
this movie is the best horror movie i have ever seen seriously if you have little kids dont let them see this,positive
this was a funny movie if you liked evil dead youll like this too,positive
now on to the parts that i think could have been better,positive
there really is nothing not to like about this film,positive
i watched this last night after not having seen it for several years,positive
i dont know what else to ask but im just writing writing writing i dont know what else to ask but im just writing writing writing,positive
this is not a film works because it is so true in what it is trying to say what went wrong more than anything he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out we would not be in them otherwise which is exactly why i liked him he is a real character,positive
he needs one and goes after it whatever she films you get it in the end but was it a movie or a dream,positive
i dont think a movie like this would be released today,positive
am i right or more i remember the early days,positive
the story is simple but fairly well written and played out there was a another whole movie right there my only real problem with the movie was the end other than that the movie was great and i highly recommend it,positive
i love dr who so much but david is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role,positive
this is an very good movie this is one that i would rent over and over again,positive
if you are not watching that movie just enjoy it dont mind about anything else,positive
well because it just feels right to be doing it on this day this movie is the result mr so is america a classic yes,positive
though they certainly got most of the film quite right,positive
it is so wonderful this dvd is a must have,positive
their is several things wrong with this film and it all has to do with the script shes very good here and i hope better roles come her way,positive
you must make it alone here do everything alone one of the boys says this is a wonderful film,positive
hes perfect in this film will probably buy this one i enjoyed it so much,positive
i love watching him in my opinion he is the greatest actor ive ever seen,positive
and yes i understand her children why i kept reading about the fantastic acting no of course not,positive
this film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors,positive
brilliant actors and brilliant picture many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this,positive
of course no one will ever remember it but it is my personal best,positive
and he could dance basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor,positive
the acting is superb throughout with special mention to a few,positive
the movie however was pretty much what i expected a lot of action with somewhat of a mystery storyline,positive
the action scenes in this movie are great there are lots of them too by the way,positive
this came as a huge surprise for me you cant go wrong with this one if you like action,positive
there are no words needed she really cant see this dance,positive
and every night after i would come home and watch it again see it before its too late,positive
you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie well you have to see it for yourself,positive
what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film this is not a sci fi nor action film of any sort,positive
all i can say is and this film let out in a bit on how and watched this film again with my best friend from high school and we are still the best of friends so its not as over the top as it seems,positive
i love the film if you like action films this is a film to definitely try,positive
this film is none of those the cast is good while not excellent,positive
i cannot for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low this was one of the most beautiful films i have seen this year their acting superb by far at the very least certainly i could see it again and again its hard to say that about any film i would highly recommend this one well done by all,positive
well the title did give that away wouldnt you think what really surprised me was the acting mind you good film though brilliant performance by the actors who bring the script to life,positive
indeed its hard to cover everything that goes on within the talk and there is a lot of it,positive
this is the single greatest movie i have ever seen youre so pretty why dont you like me you cant get away i mean who was possibly better i highly highly recommend this film everyone should own it,positive
all of these are great fun to watch but when you think about it extremely silly in the line of fire tells a story and it tells it well it felt like a true story,positive
but is it good enough to die for time will tell the whole cast seems to have a good time worth watching,positive
a must see for classic horror and sci fi fans,positive
the movie has a wonderful cast of stars some already were big and others were just getting started,positive
its not a perfect film but it definitely is its own thing,positive
why do i bring this up you get to understand them its not like they want to kill people for attention,positive
give it a try i dont think you will be disappointed,positive
a movie that you can see more than one time,positive
and so do i sometimes oh god you just need to see this,positive
wonderful wonderful family film i do love chance and how at the end he says that he has a family at last,positive
who is the killer and why is the killer after them it might sound ridiculous saying i didnt get a film like this but there is something to get,positive
i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years,positive
i didnt care that much then i was a kid,positive
what a film i can not recommend this film enough,positive
if you dont then you wont lets face it this is exactly why i find the film such fun,positive
this goes for both his acting and his directing editing and cinematography are good acting and character writing is as well,positive
i loved it the movie is really really funny and sad and original i hope it comes out soon does anyone know when i would really go see it if i were you,positive
i think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie i still dont know but what i know is that i really liked this movie but that couldnt be my favorite movie great story with great actors but with a terrible end still who made it what really happened whos that guy,positive
this film has a beginning a middle and an end,positive
it is a really funny episode and a funny show i love everything about the show and the characters,positive
great cast great acting excellent movie i wonder why i never heard of it before,positive
i took a girl friend along to see it a second time,positive
surprised to see the rather low score for this movie its like an i and i mean that in a good way,positive
this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend we had to get it,positive
often we think oh no that wont happen to me but it can,positive
thats right thats exactly what it is well it all made perfect sense to us at that time,positive
the story can be a little difficult to follow at first but all makes sense eventually,positive
of course i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there on or behind the stage things are going on and time doesnt seem to stop,positive
this is a little film with a big heart excellent acting throughout and directed with love,positive
this movie was really well written and was very entertaining there was great acting in it too the special effects were very well done i loved this movie and i know you will too,positive
excellent performance there still are good actors around this is the one,positive
thats all it is there are worse things in this world and worse movies the story isnt that bad i wont tell how it ends but its fairly predictable which isnt always a bad thing the performances in this arent that bad he is having fun himself and if you can just let yourself have fun too its not so bad i know i do every time,positive
i had seen it when it first came out on tv,positive
man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word,positive
i never heard about this movie when it was released but i watched it with my kids last night,positive
even though this movie did not get the best comments this movie made my day it got me thinking his movies always give some message to the audience,positive
how does he do it york again also is brilliant in this kind of play,positive
and not nice thing on some level this is a movie about sex,positive
this is another you must see this if only to know something about jack others are pretty interesting people who seem to become more interesting over time theres another reason to watch this she was already well into her career when called upon to work on this that scene says it all for me about how jack feels about the boys,positive
if you like the people in this one give it a shot,positive
dont ask me why i love this movie so much there is truly nothing else out there like it,positive
i absolutely hate the idea of made for television films i was surprised i look forward to seeing again,positive
while i knew it was only a b film a space western i loved it,positive
a small funny film one think is sure too funny isnt it,positive
there is very little violence and blood there is however one death sequence of note however the blood it self does not look real the movie also has one great twist in it in my mind although some people might find it predictable but i think she does a good job with what she is given and this doesnt really take away from the quality of the film but the movie doesnt hit you over the head with it i thought this movie was brilliant,positive
it probably doesnt play as well in your living room,positive
for me this made the movie worth the time it took to watch,positive
but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie i watched it and absolutely loved it every actor and actress did a superb job overall i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it go find it and watch it,positive
best british comedy at the end of the day and this film is awful i mean well done to the people involved they have made a film,positive
if you want to see a great movie this is it,positive
this is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater,positive
ok and this really is and this is a much better film,positive
i very much enjoyed watching this film i wasnt disappointed,positive
he was perfectly cast as well i was not crazy about the ending as i knew what was coming,positive
and the acting is bad the storyline is stupid but i forget to mention how funny this film is but they are pretty funny if you saw the first he was a character in that in my opinion this is better than the first watch this if you enjoy bad movies its so bad it is good,positive
worst movie of all time you cannot be serious maybe its all about what you expect a movie to do to you or,positive
he falls in love with her nothing at all all part of a days work,positive
i like the fact that with every character he became you could picture what they looked like john is real talent,positive
its just too bad that hollywood does not make enough films like this one,positive
good and mr i saw the last episode i would have liked to know what happened after,positive
and do i have to tell you the rest i cant see why,positive
ok it still looks the same now i love this movie or are you too mean,positive
i was also surprised that in all this there was a message if you have a chance see this movie,positive
this movie is still an all time favorite what is that main course,positive
youre supposed to be rating the film as a film,positive
and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want lots of it no surprise i guess,positive
after seeing the film i will kill you my girlfriend loved it too,positive
i saw this movie when i was a child i would recommend this movie to any and everyone,positive
but its really just an average show like most of the shows on tv these days,positive
everyone has problems and we all must learn to work around them the series may seem like a girls show but its not all in all great show,positive
we will never know my personal top five episodes after five characters little girl lost,positive
several things make this film a classic the music is absolutely perfect this film is one of my top sci fi films of all time,positive
at the time however i loved this movie they had a job,positive
she then goes on to find mr without taking itself too seriously,positive
the writers know their material and it shows there is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played out rent this series at once,positive
i know i did that was the easy part for me,positive
with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time ive never heard this many great songs in one movie before hes in high school who has a couple of best friends that are very funny he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her you can feel it even more in the second half but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be but its so much more than that its very entertaining and very funny i have the movie i love it,positive
unfortunately for her she is about to be found out great character work by all involved dont miss this one,positive
the effects are very good for such a small film someone called it a party movie and it is i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for,positive
and by god there are some interesting things going on this is not to say that its a masterpiece,positive
this is a movie i can watch again and again,positive
for a kids movie this is great there is a lot going on in this movie the animation was pretty good but she enjoyed the movie very much overall id say this is a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it too,positive
one of the best horror suspense movies i have seen in a long time very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it,positive
i got to meet a few of the actors and they were cool,positive
etc etc but he has finally written something that middle school kids want to read this is a good family movie,positive
typical performances from each of the three main actors who all did a good job with their roles all in all this movie is definitely worth watching,positive
i like this film a lot but overall i highly recommend this film,positive
i absolutely loved every minute of this film ill let you see whether they make it or not,positive
if there is anything better i would like to see it but so far there is none like it,positive
if you want the truth this is a very good movie it has every thing a movie should have you really should get this one,positive
ive seen this film so many times its that good am i a sad case i look forward to your next film,positive
i thought this move was very good there were a few things that were less than perfect but overall i was quite surprised,positive
the cast and script is excellent i have never seen a production that she was in that i did not like i highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone,positive
he begins to tell her that he is different inside the theater are michael and his girlfriend to tell you any more would give the ending away this is my favorite music video of all time you dont want to miss it,positive
its been one of the better horror thriller films in the past few years if not one of the best and most entertaining,positive
the story begins a small boy who looks exactly like him very much so,positive
fans throughout the entire world amazing she is a good but not great subject,positive
i would ask around and no one had ever heard of the film it is the best movie i have ever seen in my life crazy i know but that movie just means so much to me,positive
if you hate the show so much then dont watch it if you dont like it fine whatever thats your opinion this show is great yes some people find it stupid but i watched it and im top of my class its great for kids and those who are a kid at heart keep it to yourself if you hate it ok whatever,positive
if this sounds like your kind of film then it probably is,positive
pay more attention next time after this episode this is the last episode she is in,positive
now theres one thing never to do ive never read it but forget about it,positive
dont do it no well its time you do well,positive
this movie surprised me this is a movie you can watch over again say,positive
dr i never liked it when i first saw it on her and i still dont i hope more people watch this movie,positive
i dont understand why this movie has such a low rating it totally deserves more sure its completely ridiculous but thats what it was supposed to be i sure did,positive
i can see now that it is not possible every scene and shot looks like a masterpiece i do not feel like i am watching performances i feel like im watching real life if only real life could be this beautiful,positive
i feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other try to find that on tv or in the usual movies,positive
im not going to say what if you havent seen it youll have to find out for yourself the characters were like able and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it by matter of opinion,positive
she was fantastic in the role by the way i dont know if his last film has been released it was a strange but enjoyable film,positive
a wonderful cast and excellent story made this film superb,positive
i have read both the book and saw the movie today so nothing much there however this is still a beautiful movie because it makes one think and feel just like the book,positive
this is the best movie i have ever seen if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where,positive
this is what makes this movie so interesting and unique,positive
the acting by all of these actors is very good there are some really hilarious scenes in this film the movie is filmed very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end,positive
the tale is a simple one truly great stuff take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points,positive
it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie,positive
this was a romantic simple funny movie it was great he was great funny as usual the ending was romantic and happy and it was great i have seen it several times and would watch it again,positive
lets see after that i had to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friends one of the best films of the year,positive
so if you dont like this kind of music why you write here about it,positive
oh that was really cool even they got me on that scenes,positive
at least for me i could go on and this is just from the first three episodes,positive
i too saw this movie when it first came out the boy was a little much but the girl character was very interesting i would love to watch it again to see if it was as good as i remember,positive
i i want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes,positive
everything else is so perfect or at least close enough to make every shot memorable,positive
just a wonderful story i didnt know much about mr,positive
the acting is great and they all leave that is funny,positive
i believe they were telling the truth the whole time they family went through hell those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them i cant believe this case went on for so long i feel for this family and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them i would i have no idea what they went through i cant even imagine it i think everyone should watch this,positive
i would recommend this film to everyone if youre not sure just watch it anyway its only an hour and a half of your life,positive
the story and the characters were some of the best ive ever seen,positive
home room came as a total surprise we dont realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school,positive
i loved this movie this film is a must see entertaining emotional i do have to say that i recommend watching the movie first then read the book some for the better and some for the worst,positive
i couldnt believe the comments made about the movie i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great roles you go girl,positive
and then only too little and too late he has to make things right,positive
actually id love to be part of it i mean really,positive
the actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast,positive
sometimes it feels like youre watching a documentary i loved it,positive
when he doesnt b but one cant quite stop here the end they take on lives of their own s,positive
the rest of the cast is good good enough to make this little thriller work i was surprise by the plot which is not the first time it was used if you got the chance to see it go for it,positive
the writing the acting the story lines everything about this show is absolutely amazing it really is a work of art and im sure who ever gives it a chance will love it just as much as i do,positive
if i had kids i would not let them watch this it is now on dvd so go out and buy it,positive
i guess we see what we want to see i think youll like it,positive
but surprise i went because i knew i was seeing a work of art,positive
and here they are you like lost you have to watch it,positive
all in all i definitely recommend this movie really good,positive
thats the genre question for two hours and a fun film it is,positive
whatever you do dont stop watching when you think the movie is over,positive
it is difficult today and in the us to understand this movie many would say that this is the story of their lives reading the reviews here i can see that few understand this film,positive
but to my surprise i really enjoyed this the girl did an okay job i guess its hard since it was her first performance and being so young the other was a very simple story there will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor,positive
this is a wonderful film it is not an easy thing to do,positive
to my surprise the acting wasnt bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good,positive
fun movie great for the kids they found it very entertaining,positive
i actually had seen the last parts of this movie when i was a child the ending left hope that the main character would get back to earth eventually it was a shame it did not make it to a series if you liked this feature the other one is worth a watch yet different,positive
a perfect family film great movie the best i love this movie and you guys should too its a great movie i mean it a great movie go and see it if you havent i love him so much,positive
she was such a great actor for being so little but she really seemed to be in character perfectly,positive
the special effects are amazing and the cinematography couldnt be better it also makes a good point if you can find this movie definitely see it,positive
truly you just arent at all able to see the world other than through your own eyes thats sad,positive
its absolutely perfect as it is one does not understand all but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture its absolutely perfect as it is,positive
man i just cant say enough about this film but ill stop here,positive
i think they work quite well together although not seen by many people i dont even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie i wish they would eventually release this on dvd,positive
this was a very entertaining flick only one way to find out,positive
it is about love see the movie you will love it,positive
the whole film is told from his point of view so we are forced to feel what he feels,positive
i would just like to say that no matter how low budget the film is it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies having this series out on dvd has made me want to read the whole series and want more,positive
as much as you would want to believe it these stories never happen the director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors so why dont we make a better one,positive
first of all i just have to say that im a huge lost fan its got everything in it really cant wait,positive
i loved it wonderful great cinematography and some amazing kill scenes brilliant the first one takes over a half hour and then we get down times between them,positive
whats its message after all the film is not about that well who wanted to do that,positive
great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun give it a shot,positive
it was very difficult to watch so real of course if they had it today i am sure it would have been fine,positive
based on the novel by a man on fire would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time but this is still a better than average crime thriller,positive
i enjoyed this film at the beginning i thought it would be the worst movie ive seen but then as it went on it got better and i couldnt turn away,positive
thats where i first saw and heard of this one let this one out,positive
this is a really fun movie you will love this movie dont expect oscar quality,positive
we loved it so much at the time please release this on dvd i know many many people who still talk about the show,positive
then you will be a big fan of this movie shame go out and rent this movie,positive
she has a very nice voice everyone in the picture did a fine job this movie was fun,positive
it is so stupid at times that it can only be hilarious,positive
why water down such a great storyline the directing cinematography and soundtrack and acting was good the screenplay was average,positive
it isnt for eyes of children i had to fast forward quite a number of scenes if it is just entertainment you are looking for then this movie has it all that is if you do good you will get good and if you do evil you will get evil in real life this is not always true,positive
so many movies which seemed so important to me back then i no or me by all means rent or buy a copy,positive
well directed and i thought the lead actor put in a superb performance,positive
im not sure either of my kids really got the movie but i have to say that it was a wonderful short film,positive
superb use of music it keeps you really with it while its set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party you made my day,positive
time has not been kind to this movie overall pretty entertaining,positive
i am going to have to see this one again to get everything,positive
i like this movie she is very good i voice with this movie,positive
however the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it,positive
as far as murder mystery films go it just doesnt get any better than this one,positive
after the end i did not have the feeling that i knew the man any much better that was a close one or an older america,positive
the characters are interesting and you really care for them dont miss it,positive
this movie was an excellent acted excellent directed and overall had an excellent story,positive
this is a film experience that i will remember for a long time to come,positive
when it is anything but simple yes and that is why the film works so well ridiculous if this film is about that then it is about how bad it is this being said the film is indeed a great film,positive
on the crime front it shows the truth see for yourself to see what goes down i dont know thats a good thing done well and well done,positive
you dont want to watch but just have too enjoy,positive
just about the time school started how do you end a movie like this oh i do love much of the movie,positive
does the dog have something to do with it the music was creepy and even the ending which i wont tell made you think its worth watching,positive
i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was,positive
to anyone who might think this show isnt for them please give it a try,positive
these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them,positive
even the kids are great wonderful show so sad that its gone,positive
also this movie is far too long this was a huge hit in its day,positive
that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end i think it is a perfect movie otherwise,positive
the whole cast just went with anything when it came to the jokes,positive
is that what we all are is that all that we want to be,positive
however if this style of comedy is not your favorite you probably wont like it but that is with any comedy movie,positive
if you actually thought about it there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life,positive
and many many other fantastic things are all of them believable and first rate special effects no way excellent,positive
many of the american people would say what to my opening comment,positive
we all really loved it a lot i am going to see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out it is really good,positive
it was completely worth it this movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end however this should come real close to being his greatest,positive
she and mr there are no weak performances in the film s,positive
he gives a pretty decent performance but there is nothing a list about him,positive
i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie,positive
i loved this film i saw it opening night and loved it some people told me that this film wasnt any good and to stay away but i thought it was great i cant wait until this film comes out to video so i can get it and see it over and over again,positive
i just had to get that out of the way but as a story amazing film making out of this world classic yes,positive
the very things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things that i love shes funny when it came out on dvd i was first in line to buy it its a great kids movie,positive
do the dramatic moments work the message of the movie is superb how do i know how many movies can you say that about,positive
i love this movie but if not does anyone know where i can find it it was a great movie and had great actors and i dont see why it was taken off the air,positive
what a fun movie the main theme is so memorable i havent been able to get it out of my head for two days a second viewing might just clear this up,positive
nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives,positive
i couldnt follow the story oh man why cant we have stuff like this coming out of hollywood,positive
every scene is classic the acting is real its that good great job everyone who worked on this great job this movie is real its a true movie experience which i will never forget i recommend this movie to fans of drama suspense and horror above almost every other film,positive
it is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more watch it to have a good time,positive
not the best of movies but definitely well worth watching,positive
a i cant believe this film has never been put out on video or dvd,positive
people should watch it just for the experience because its totally one of a kind dont expect much of it very funny,positive
overall the movie was great and i enjoyed watching it even if there were parts that could have been better,positive
back in the day also has a couple of romantic scenes i like movies with suspense i also like this movie because everything falls in place if you really pay attention to it,positive
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film,positive
keep in mind though that there was a war going on at the time,positive
actually reality doesnt have much of these either at least not in my life so watch this movie for the characters excellent acting very believable,positive
if it is in a theater near you go its not a funny feel good movie its more along the lines of a feel and think movie as in life,positive
but first hes got a real problem thats where the comedy comes in,positive
it was set up perfectly and how they got all of that footage is amazing,positive
i really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot,positive
it is totally a bad movie but i cant help it i like this movie,positive
i have never been a fan of their show or their movies now as for the rest of the film its all a lot of fun and is entertaining,positive
it well written well acted and well cast i liked everything in this movie well worth a look,positive
as far as i knew it was doing very well with a lot of viewers how bad was the show doing please,positive
that is a major plus one would think who knows,positive
how did i hear about it but why the poor reviews for this movie,positive
let me tell you something this movie is probably as good or better than city of god i recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema,positive
he is what he is good work to them i say,positive
there is much more to this film than first meets the eye,positive
now i dont know about you but i thought this was great im not sure when its getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out,positive
i loved most of the script but did not like the ending the two leads did an amazing job they were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing stars if she were dead the ending would be much more believable but he doesnt come across that way in the script so watch the movie enjoy the performance and make up your own mind,positive
the acting isnt too bad and the plot is pretty good,positive
the directing and acting in this film are very good,positive
and good job too it had a script too lets just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first one,positive
i had to see this show and that is what i really did he does have a cool character so if you to see something good then see this show its the best,positive
this is one of the best films i have seen in years,positive
this movie doesnt really fall into any particular genre the wife of dr a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but thats all not too bad really it has some funny parts sad parts really sad parts and well you know what i mean if youve seen this movie already like it and are thinking about getting the dvd i would highly recommend it,positive
what in hell were they thinking when they cast her all in all id say this version is wonderful and i recommend that everyone see this version,positive
there is a lot to this story i thought i was watching the sound of music for a second and nearly lost hope for the movie,positive
this movie is based on a true story which has made history,positive
he is so great she looks a bit too old for the role,positive
they really work well together but each to their own i loved it and highly recommend it,positive
sometimes a movie is so bad its kind of good but this is fine this is one of those movies that you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it is not,positive
its a shame that more people have not seen it yet i wonder if i should call this a horror film,positive
if youre a fan of the song like i am you pretty much know how it ends,positive
we have all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different,positive
i happen to run into this movie one night so i decided to watch it i thought it was a wonderful plot i thought it was a great movie,positive
it is not a simple right or wrong it needs a whole new way of thinking,positive
now having seen it for the second time so much later i dont find it hilarious something like that,positive
i have to say though that i loved this movie when was little and i still love it today i would definitely recommend it to anyone i know or dont know,positive
i for one dont think it should be taken seriously when watched as it is very enjoyable what i think is amazing is the budget this movie had,positive
the characters were amazing and believable well lets get serious this movie shows it a person can really learn a lot from watching this,positive
and thats how the greatest comedy of tv started enjoy friends,positive
this is one of the best action films i have seen,positive
what you have here is a true thriller drama well worth watching,positive
try it especially if youre not a monster fan this is not a horror flick,positive
and it would worth it because its for me just one the best french movie ever made because of the why a lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written so whats love,positive
love is not something they say or do it is a love story where love means having to say youre sorry,positive
i never got the chance to see it though the acting is actually pretty decent i would recommend for a scary thriller,positive
mr five minutes into the film i knew it was going to be very good i have never before watched a film three times in one night mr,positive
it is a really good show to watch b is pretty funny the kids are very cool too but then the second one was different to be new episodes,positive
ever its that good put it like this the first time i saw it the effect wasnt working so i told my friend it would have been nice if my friend said thats exactly what happens its not working for some reason you will not be disappointed,positive
i like it still and never do you love me,positive
this movie is wonderful it always has been always will be and the music a dream is a wish your heart makes is beautiful,positive
this is what a high budget movie can not do mostly i liked it this is a must see one,positive
as for the look of the film it could not be better,positive
but thats exactly what i got i cannot wait to see where the characters end up next,positive
if there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it but superb anyway whatever you do do not miss it,positive
though i liked on the town better i really liked it i think that is better too,positive
okay so this wasnt what i was expecting but this film had b movie all over it so if you like to laugh rent this one,positive
i watched this movie with my girlfriend last night it does i loved this movie an amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too if you havent seen this movie get it and watch it,positive
the one and only was a great film sad funny and all around great,positive
there is a need for this kind of entertainment in our modern world,positive
if hollywood would make more quality films i would probably go to the cinema more,positive
i really liked this movie is to me so very moving all in all if youre looking for light comedy i would not recommend this movie at all,positive
i dont know what it is with this movies theres only one real problem i have with this movie and thats the fact that its told in a history book way,positive
i just could not believe it they really can make it through anything,positive
this film was a lot better than id expected it to be,positive
its a little cheap history however was not much cheap entertainment here,positive
i loved this movie there are not any movies for young children i loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said stupid my daughter can not stop talking about it i hope to see more family films like this one i can not say enough about this movie i look forward to many more films like this one,positive
i really didnt see this one coming perhaps the best film ive ever seen,positive
this movie is so simple i dont think i can recommend this movie to everyone but i do recommend this movie to people who want to watch real cinema,positive
just watched this and it was amazing so if you are dont let the dull cover put you off the script is one of the best ever well i cant really find anything enjoy,positive
the entire story was well thought out i thought the cast and crew did an excellent job i thought the screen play was well written and directed,positive
the acting was very good by everyone involved you can tell why this movie was based on a play its probably very good on stage,positive
it just goes to show how wrong you can be i had not expected to like this film there were a couple of great characters what really makes this work is how big it is the violence is so big,positive
the same was true for the father and son in this film see this movie tell your friends to see it,positive
there are various little performances that stand out especially the women basically this film is a murder mystery and as such its excellent,positive
i loved this movie from beginning to end i almost never got to see this amazing movie well earlier than usual i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did,positive
i tried guys i really tried i tried so hard not to watch this movie i cant believe i am saying this but i loved this movie all im saying guys is you might want to try this movie,positive
mr great family entertainment and we need more films like this today,positive
simply one of the greatest films ever made and an almost perfect work of art,positive
they meet up with a woman who is trying to break into show business,positive
maybe ever if it comes to your town and you want to see a movie that makes you think this is it i love this film,positive
if you havent seen this movie than you need to so you have to you must see this move did i mention the music is good too so you should like it if you enjoy music,positive
you should watch this show though because all in all its very funny even if it is stupid at times,positive
this film certainly shows her in her best light yet this is film at its best,positive
i thought this movie had a lot going for it the acting was great,positive
i dont think i need to tell you the story for it has been told for years and years,positive
boy are they bad too and not to give anything away she is even more bad than the other he had something of a career the movie is not bad i truly dont know where it was shown and i think the audience is meant to also,positive
this is the best movie ive ever seen the movie tells the truth believe me,positive
i have this film on video and watch it every so often and i enjoy it each and every time,positive
a killer thats as old or even older then man himself,positive
a powerful piece of work this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time,positive
it has been some years since i saw this but remember it and would like to see it again then he gets a chance to find out if you were on it you were all that i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change,positive
this movie makes me want to fall in love all over again,positive
sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the story,positive
this is your great story or can you for me it would not be so yes,positive
this is one of the best non english series i have seen,positive
this is better then the first this is just a great movie,positive
the performances were excellent as was the story just when i thought this film was about to slow down it didnt the camera was always in the right place love that,positive
it so great to see a black family on tv worth watching great show for the family,positive
cut its a mess but its a rather enjoyable mess,positive
i was always a big fan of this movie first of all have you seen the cast the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well,positive
his music especially what we hear of it here is very slow its a great work,positive
i was there this year and it was wonderful the town appears today as it did when the movie was made,positive
i thought this movie was fantastic it was hilarious i know i dont even my family found it funny and thats saying something,positive
the movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long that arent important,positive
this movie turned out to be one laugh after another if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours definitely check this one out,positive
no matter its a long movie but it doesnt feel that way,positive
excellent story also few women have watched the movie but they rate it more highly than men,positive
the cast are great the rest of the cast are also good,positive
its the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that that was awful and the other half will leave thinking what was that that was cool it definitely wasnt perfect though however there were many good things too well you have to see it,positive
we have the same here its a real great movie and worst a rent even have it at home,positive
if you havent seen it theres only one thing to do better still buy this movie,positive
im a little slow ok all in all a light simple comedy quite short and quite enjoyable,positive
its not just about entertainment not even to make out in the cinema,positive
it has drama it has comedy it has a story its one of the greatest movies ever made period,positive
why one of the best movies i have ever seen,positive
its just hilarious the entire cast of the movie has done great job,positive
its just not all over the place like the tv shows it is many things overall it is an experience,positive
it is predictable from the first five minutes on all in all the movie is a dog,positive
the plot is really good and the actors act great,positive
william is a great actor i feel he never got his due,positive
its a small world and this little movie shows us,positive
ive also been looking to find this movie for quite some time and how great it would be to find it on dvd,positive
this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year it actually has a point just a well put together movie if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor you will find this to be a really good movie,positive
great musical and a film you will not want to miss this is truly a great classic film enjoy,positive
you have to see it to believe it the best thing you can do on earth is not miss earth,positive
i think i will now go on to read the novel brilliant movie,positive
all the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hour,positive
it has a very good story and another thing i love an even better twist ending stuff to point out,positive
i absolutely loved this movie the actors in my opinion did an excellent job so sorry about this what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it,positive
to me it is exactly that lack that makes this film work the characters and their problems seem real and because of that i care about what happens to them,positive
but i enjoyed this show anyway but you know what i really liked it,positive
we didnt know what to expect other than who and what it was about if you like this movie read the book,positive
the writing and performances were both first rate that was great out of,positive
it is a great show i just wish it wasnt on so late at night as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time i read some comments this way i can see it from the beginning,positive
the story would have been much better as a half hour tv episode,positive
i thought she wasnt the right person for this role i just couldnt see her as a rock star girlfriend but as the movie goes on you somehow realize that she did a good job with this,positive
thats how the movie begins the story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter they really look like mother daughter the soundtrack is also great,positive
the beauty the horror i myself didnt even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when i went into this movie,positive
i t s t the leading man though did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show t,positive
a there are also some plot problems they turn in good interesting performances,positive
this has got to be the best movie ive ever seen its a must watch,positive
but you dont need to buy the message to have a good time take a couple hours and see this film they will not have been wasted,positive
it was because i was so young at the time,positive
ok this movie was cool i dont think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun,positive
dont miss this film that you can take the whole family to see and all will enjoy it,positive
the acting fantastic the story amazing the script wonderful i recommend this movie and the book very very much,positive
but thats not all thats strange about him and then strange things begin to happen again,positive
what a shame shame indeed however there is another version out though,positive
but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on,positive
if this is ever on dvd im getting it a s a,positive
there are only two things i didnt like about the movie the rest i thought was well done and i liked it enough to recommend it to friends i must say it was full of action because of that but after about the second scene i knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene i like to be surprised by the next scene not know what is going to happen before it does i think that was true she still did a good job i just thought the other two were better even though we dont hear much about them they were a part of that time,positive
i cant help you which is a shame because the movie is great why,positive
all in all its a great show but not perfect,positive
thats the only reason i love it so much i love it,positive
okay well not exactly but guess what the movie will make you laugh in parts,positive
first off the cast is superb second off the story was quite good also,positive
there are so many wonderful scenes in this film i cant wait to see his other films,positive
i dont want to tell the plot because its not whats most important about this film but you can be sure that its interesting and original the best part of this movie is the cinematography,positive
actually theyre the only good parts of the movie i thought it made the movie stand out more if you want one hell of a good time then be sure to check this out,positive
i wanted to watch this to get a inside look at the show still thought it was great this is a good thing go figure,positive
well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast,positive
i saw this movie last night and thought it was decent it has its moments i guess you would say,positive
this one is not so great however i dont know what happened to the first two parts of this movie i dont know how they could release this movie like that anyway the last part isnt to bad so wait for the video and see it then,positive
no great storyline little action well done well worth the effort,positive
trying to find it today is hard enough but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age but even the voice acting is far better than much released today,positive
did i mention its a romantic comedy the romantic elements also work because of that reason,positive
this show started out with great mystery episodes still it is a good show,positive
if you have the chance watch it i do every time i see it and i own it and have watched it many times,positive
a check it out on video its worth a look,positive
this was a great romantic comedy he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working,positive
there had never been a film quite like it before and there will certainly not be anything like it again,positive
i think this movie is pretty good this movie seems to have a view of the future the acting wasnt bad the characters were pretty good as well recommend for fans of saw,positive
no forget all that its a show thats very much of its time but is that a bad thing i for one dont think so,positive
over all performances were good in the film but not great what i would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her,positive
this movie was great it had everything a true action fan could want this is great stuff,positive
there are only a few bad things about this series first the picture and sound quality is so so at least in the first couple of episodes so on to the good things and there are a lot of them there are a lot of other great actors here too its not over the top but believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting see it,positive
just watched this one again i wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time i loved this movie sure its cheap but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film,positive
i got what i had expected and so much more,positive
as it will next year and the year after that,positive
you got it right thats why the boys were so close,positive
what a great movie the war scenes were amazing camera work excellent and plot beautiful i didnt understand the songs but they were excellent,positive
is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car for such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long for how long a year later maybe,positive
because of the great premise you feel like you have to watch it to the end,positive
but i liked it i recommend this film but dont expect too much just enjoy it,positive
it is one of the best movies i have ever seen i never thought that a movie could change the way i think like this before it did,positive
i would hope so and how can i get involved i own this movie and can never watch it enough,positive
i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means enjoy it,positive
the plot is poor so is the acting a few scenes are really well directed if you want rent it but dont expect a great horror experience,positive
it seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life of course some of the story lines are not realistic so what,positive
turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie i am not saying this is a great classic,positive
this movie is much better than i expected i expected it to be more of a comedy but i wasnt too disappointed,positive
yes its all over the place know that going in the production quality or lack of becomes one of the many running jokes go with it and youll be in for a good time,positive
the story goes like this i like the theme of the movie,positive
this is the thriller of the year no doubt all the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun go see it,positive
of watching this as a child its no dream my friend,positive
all of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining,positive
so i am sure that you will not be disappointed with see no evil because it is a really good movie so make sure that you rent or buy see no evil because it is just so great,positive
his character is like all of us i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep a funny film,positive
unfortunately this movie never made it to dvd i was not disappointed the movie is about a lot of things it is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other i think sometimes this is good,positive
another thing i like about the show is the quality of the camera work now for the bad or are you s oh please,positive
i absolutely love this movie one is to be different is just that different,positive
go watch it it is very deep there are some great laughs in this one then you will get all the inside jokes,positive
i enjoyed this movie very much i special effects i highly recommend this movie,positive
give me a break to tell the truth i hate horror movies,positive
i saw the movie by myself i keep thinking of that sound though and i do not like it the ending scene too,positive
this movie is really special its a very beautiful movie theyre making new friend life friends this is absolutely one of my favorite movies at that time they didnt know each other at least not like friends i think the first hour are the best its so beautiful so if you havent seen this movie you really should because its wonderful but sad,positive
i guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore i think the movie is quite good anyway,positive
i love this film i dont think there isnt a moment that hes in that he isnt funny this is a great film that no action fan can do without,positive
this time he comes the he leaves robert says that he too needs to experience men and they make love to each other she is on top of him doesnt want to let him go and she does care about him he tried to kill himself but couldnt do it they look at each other the end,positive
oh the acting was not superb nor was the plot but it was worth watching,positive
i think its an excellent film but i did not enjoy watching it,positive
i love this movie short thing his style of animation is very original,positive
i dont think anyone else could have written this not here,positive
the movie has heart the cast look and act like real people,positive
i enjoyed every moment of this movie even though i knew they could never really be together,positive
its a just great time if you dont feel like taking yourself too seriously,positive
is it for the atmosphere of the movie and ask why is it there is there a place for them they dont have a right to be here,positive
people need to give this show a chance the people who write bad reviews there are very few of them are clearly people who havent seen many episodes also for the most part the acting is superb,positive
feels like watching a live play great camera works and i was sad it was over can not wait until it is on the big screen i recommend you take your family to this movie good show for a night with them,positive
he knows the art of film making and can use it very well,positive
however this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time,positive
theres nothing much to the story but no they dont talk her into it nothing is wasted the acting isnt bad at all,positive
i cant believe i am saying this but this is by far the best dr who i know whatever you do if you ever loved dr who or sci fi see this,positive
but other than that this movie is really great it really makes you think and its all worth it in the end,positive
that more people havent seen it is a true crime,positive
but what would you think if it was otherwise an old woman a young guy,positive
women will love the story and characters but theres something for the men here too,positive
that was a great episode an example that this tv show shows the family working things out as a family i recommend this show for everyone,positive
did you even see this movie i doubt it if i ever find this movie on dvd i will definitely buy it of course too bad because it is funny funny funny,positive
i really loved the rich family background portrayed in the show i thought and still think they should bring it back robert,positive
its not for everyone especially those who arent into feel good movies and this is definitely one if you like everything to be perfect and make sense avoid this one,positive
the first time i saw this film i loved it,positive
but the more i watch it the more i love it its well worth it,positive
i love this movie very much i watched it over and over i dont see why anyone would think this movie wasnt good it might be a little like pretty woman but i havent seen that and i dont think its any better than this,positive
the plot is easy to follow definitely a great buy,positive
they work together so well that every father and son should see this you can tell that they are a close family i wish we could all have that experience,positive
this film is not at all as bad as some people on here are saying,positive
the first kill in my opinion is the best i will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and i was let down a bit myself,positive
but she enjoyed it the whole way through the only problem is that it is very predictable,positive
just keep going and be who you are anyway liked it hope to see more,positive
i highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor,positive
when i heard the title of the film i thought it was going to be different perhaps in not such a good way but i was wrong,positive
etc for this viewer anyway those days are long over hard to say very good movie with good performances,positive
i liked the plot of the movie it gave something to think about other than a comedy a very well used plot line,positive
a good film with strong performances especially the two leads,positive
because every shot is worth taking the time to look and there is plenty of time,positive
this is actually great fun plus the ending was quite funny the direction is very good the acting is a lot of fun rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one,positive
this was a great show to watch and ill tell you why it was a great show,positive
but the film has so many other things to make it almost a modern classic truly that of a great actor,positive
these movies are both based on a same plot line but both of them are perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own and i am still thinking about it the story is great and the ending is a bit funny all in all a great work of art,positive
but never mind all that its an enjoyable romantic comedy but its never dull,positive
we were disappointed there but it was still a great movie,positive
would like to see more of this type of film interesting characters and the overall story line was interesting,positive
however the thing i didnt love was some of the writing good job,positive
just love it if you havent seen it yet check it out,positive
its nice to see nice kids in a modern day film,positive
i mean well lets get real what would you like to see,positive
if you havent seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level,positive
the special effects are very good as is the story line many great british actors are in this film as young men,positive
it has all the elements of what i love to see in a sci fi story in a book or on the screen,positive
watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time,positive
i cant say any more as it would give away the plot be sure to see this one,positive
it has a great cast old what a actress a must see movie,positive
but the story and the characters are so strong it really doesnt matter a must see for any animation fan,positive
quite simply the best reality show ever made can you figure out,positive
i saw this movie once on late night t and knew it was the best movie ever the whole movie is great,positive
i just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it as much as the first time,positive
all characters are brilliant mr so please release it let it go so the fans can and will enjoy it try it you might just like it,positive
i found it hard to like anyone in this film well,positive
the theme simple and you dont know each other either good but not great somewhat far down on the list but still there,positive
i cant remember what scene was playing please help me with this question,positive
one can just totally forget reality and have a good time nice film,positive
and least some of her then i could enjoy the rest of the movie within minutes,positive
i saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago together this movie is very moving its a funny movie i wonder how they did it i recommend them all,positive
i dont think so what a great face that man has,positive
but you probably have seen it or else you wouldnt be here,positive
i need a life also my favorite line in the entire movie was from mr but it wouldnt well thats all i would like to say about this movie oh one more thing that is all,positive
thats because it was easy to find nothing in hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange a sit back and enjoy,positive
like an old friend definitely worth seeing if you get the chance,positive
in ways it was funny and dramatic but that is what makes a movie one thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music i have never heard anything like it they all had a hard time but made it their own way,positive
this film is very interesting it is fine everything is fine see that also you will have an experience,positive
this film is a must see for anyone if you havent seen it go rent it you will not be sorry amazing,positive
i love this movie this ones worth watching more than once and showing to all your friends,positive
while it was extremely entertaining it also had a big message to it,positive
i love the cast and the story but it was so good,positive
oh my god what a story this movie is very good and it had to be god who had this happen i hope most of that stuff you put in there was true also oh and some parts were funny and others i was just really happy,positive
i love it all the story lines are so good the show is basically about this family called the days and their lives he was by far my favorite character,positive
is this a bad movie the movie was quite funny and great to watch these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen,positive
the acting from the main cast is as usual great but is that really all there is to it,positive
this movie is not only one you will want to see its also one you will definitely want to own a copy of,positive
i did not expect to enjoy this and this was not it,positive
i liked top gun predictable plot decent character development and story line especially women,positive
america is on top right now everyone needs to get on with their lives only one problem though they have to get new lives remember that,positive
the actors must have had lots of fun making it,positive
i own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released,positive
this the final of the three was definitely one of the good ones the storyline is simple but well told this movie didnt have that but it had the best story,positive
and it didnt so this movie never really had a chance,positive
at the end of the movie i still dont know whether i liked it or not those who think and write i would,positive
the japanese version has its good and bad points too,positive
i only know a few of the young cast in the movie thats another story in the book,positive
s this is not a war movie you may think the film is too long,positive
this movie was almost perfect and seeing as nothing in this world can be truly perfect that is pretty good the actual directing seems to have been well thought through and the script must have been amazing,positive
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time,positive
and to find out that they really didnt go by a script and sort of made it up as they went the rest are all great as well there is no weak character,positive
its hard no to say that monster man is really entertaining it deserves more attention in the big screen,positive
well i like how it is just a good time like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way,positive
its really funny and i dont see how anyone could not like this film i really really really want to watch the rest of the movie it will please you,positive
and that would be a crime good for a laugh or a few laughs really but watch the japanese one first,positive
she is the whole picture the rest of the cast is good,positive
this movie is mostly all dialogue based this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe,positive
it is a classic in every sense of the word i love it and i think most people will too,positive
b movie yes yes first movie yes etc problems take it for what it is a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie for what it is just that it is really good,positive
this person needs to get back into the business perhaps directing,positive
great script you will enjoy this film go see it,positive
what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another all are perfectly cast,positive
when will they ever learn this film is extremely well done i should add that she is also a fantastic actress as well,positive
i watched it over and over and it never got boring,positive
i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that but the romance between them because i sure was the ending would have killed the movie,positive
no matter what version you have seen must see movie,positive
well we definitely did see and i and many other people were actually expecting worse first off the acting was above average the directing was average to me the dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out the writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level well that is some of what we saw at least s overall though it was entertaining,positive
this is fantastic everything from the score to when the final credits role this movie is a masterpiece its one of my favorite horror movies and always will be money well spent,positive
this is a funny movie this was worth seeing in the theater we needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out takes at the end do not leave at the start of the credits,positive
that tells you everything you need to know so go and watch it the animation is really good and above tv average the best thing about this series is that there is finally something new and the best thing a movie is coming soon,positive
all ten episodes are pretty good the perfect day is also good unfortunately this series is not on dvd,positive
until now will buy it when it comes out on dvd for sure,positive
i enjoyed this film i dont always care the people he plays but hes an excellent actor which is what movies are all about,positive
and this movie isnt bad at all doesnt matter though youll enjoy yourself anyway,positive
but if you keep at it you may just make it to the end well i dont know see this its weird and its worth your time,positive
its simply amazing the water effects are really nice too if you ever see the water it looks so real because the effects they put in it so this game seems to be like a masterpiece but its still a great game,positive
tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did to see or not to see thats the,positive
this is a good movie period it almost feels like this was a true story this was back when tv movies were actually good,positive
this is a wonderful film even though at the time this wasnt an a list cast this one is no different so who was the beautiful one,positive
not much of it makes sense but that doesnt matter she apparently was just working for her check be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie,positive
well everything to cut a long story short but thats not all oh there is so much more,positive
there are other films that i cant remember at the moment but all of them are powerful,positive
its a fun film before all this is not a perfect film either,positive
a must see then again what do i know im only a child,positive
after i watched the films i liked the fighting scenes if you want to watch a film without thinking this is the film for you but i got to admit,positive
its so red youll see what i mean one more little note,positive
they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable acting,positive
i would love to see this as a full feature film,positive
a little too late for that if you ask me,positive
fight scenes were good it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre it was definitely worth watching,positive
i really enjoyed the film even though the plot was a bit predictable overall i really enjoyed this film,positive
this show surprised me in the best way possible not only is the show well written story lines are realistic funny and enjoyable etc but this show is anything but dont doubt this show it is truly enjoyable to watch,positive
overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch,positive
i love his role in this movie actually the whole cast in this movie was enjoyable and great i would recommend that anyone see this movie watch it and enjoy,positive
im giving ten out of ten its one of the best movies ever the very best mr the very best ever,positive
the story is decent the acting is good the writing and direction are well done,positive
you either love the movie or hate it the ending was also wonderful,positive
i enjoyed this movie well directed well acted and a good story,positive
the best day of my life was about to happen,positive
mr im has done it again this mr the most amazing thing about this film is a cinematography and the script is perfect too,positive
man this is a hard dvd to come by was it worth it well yes,positive
then later on though it was good but not great its still my favorite episode although the series did live up to it although shes my least favorite i still like her these are only a few of my favorite episodes,positive
this is a good script with several stories going on at the same time,positive
character development just wasnt a big thing in this film,positive
a really great documentary up there with the world at war for me the dvd is of excellent quality,positive
i saw this movie on tv and loved it the cast was made of some really interesting people he can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few others can the story line is great too and this movie brings it out in such a way that is almost totally believable,positive
but thats not what this film is all about or are we just trying to understand after its already too late and why is it always someone you would never have expected it to be did you know who it would be but if you dont open your eyes youll never know until its too late,positive
it took me by surprise even though i should have expected it from the team involved with this movie in going to dr not only is he a fantastic actor but he makes us believe he is that man,positive
if your looking for an oscar its not here brother,positive
as much as i liked the movie and thought it was very well done i was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book unfortunately i did not get to ask him a question i never quite could find a real life version of her i hope one day too,positive
this show is amazing i love each and every episode nice husband right wife of the year,positive
lost isnt the greatest tv show in history but its not far off i love the way i cant guess whats going to happen,positive
the movie was very good while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didnt figure out who did it i have seen every actor whos played him,positive
i could mention several sequences however it is better to see the movie i loved it,positive
having a baby sister you know how it is i was like ok there we go again,positive
okay so i love silly movies if you enjoy silly sci fi movies over the top movies or if you are a fan of mr this movie is all that i wanted it to be its a wonderful silly b movie its fun its not classic or anything but if its on tv some night watch it,positive
anyway i liked this movie very much i own this on dvd and would not part with,positive
his role here though took a completely different turn it does get better however maybe it was nice to see him in a role that i could actually enjoy overall then i liked it,positive
it is very scary the characters are good i love the whole plot i did not see the japanese version i recommend this to horror fans,positive
but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but i didnt mind,positive
first of all i must say i really enjoy watching this movie the way we follow the different people at the same time works perfectly and its one of those movies that really makes you think did you,positive
the guy had a long run of better than average films,positive
first of all this is an art film and a good one at that very cool however if youre into film you have to see this,positive
first of all let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously,positive
great performances from the two leads they were very believable as friends,positive
the characters are very well played and the humor here and there is amazing it sure is a very powerful gay movie,positive
what does this man want from her this is a movie you should see,positive
but there is much more to this movie it is a sad day for all of us,positive
and for an action comedy it was very well done etc etc,positive
and this time its personal if youve seen bad girls well this is a little bit better in the ways of the female characters,positive
if the case is the other then you will very probably like it its as simple as that good for you he is quite good isnt he enjoy,positive
it was a great production and the cast was perfect in their roles,positive
one of my favorite movies of all time makes me want to find love like that,positive
this film is really cool every thing looks like it came out of the comic book but its a fan film so we cant expect them to be the greatest it was cool this is a movie i would definitely see if it were real,positive
doing it right makes it seem easy but doing it wrong is there anything worse than a bad comedy,positive
you cant take this movie seriously rent buy it and enjoy,positive
seriously nothing so take this second film as a stand alone and it certainly has its moments no are his lines as good no but he is funny the film is predictable but arent most in this genre,positive
are you crazy or what just let other people enjoy the movie,positive
i really do hope he gets to make better films in the future,positive
he isnt very good no hes not playing himself it basically just gives up at the end its also far too happy i still liked the film,positive
a wonderful story so beautiful told go see it feel it,positive
what a surprise the one scene that is really funny is when dr,positive
for the simple reason that there isnt a clear story or even a plot characters clearly some other viewers didnt understand whats so beautiful and interesting in this movie dont tell anyone,positive
this is by far the best movie ive seen in a long while it is not boring nor is it too dramatic i wish i had found this movie earlier more lines more lines,positive
i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv,positive
in some ways this movie is the comedy version of american beauty but in others it is a world apart the film has a lot of fun with its material the actors have a lot of fun with their characters too the black comedy,positive
this movie needs to be put on dvd it was so funny and i loved it,positive
s this is one of the most important and powerful films i have seen in quite some time you will not be disappointed,positive
if you have any feeling for beauty nature and art do not miss this fantastic film,positive
i know there are some people who dont like them and thats fine this happens to be my favorite one in the series,positive
mr this is how all car movies should be made,positive
and it was another one of those movies that i saw when i was young sad scary,positive
and boy are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie see this movie,positive
i loved this film wish id seen it at the cinema in its everything come on,positive
the movie is not great but it has a lot of great elements the story is slow and weak but entertaining the music is pretty good and the gore is good i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable it was still enjoyable there was no sex scenes i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do,positive
exactly what makes a good piece of writing into a classic,positive
it was entertaining again not a classic but entertaining none the less,positive
if you are expecting more of the same from the first movie you will be disappointed but this is still a good movie,positive
i really enjoyed this movie the movie has a happy ending,positive
it was that funny i havent seen it since but would love to where do you get a copy each one,positive
the whole movie was really hilarious i would really recommend this movie,positive
i thought this movie was very well done it was well cast and believable,positive
i enjoyed this movie he gets better with every film he does,positive
the cast are all very good and they play their roles very well the story is simple and predictable but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny,positive
this was an excellent film i dont understand why so many people dont like it,positive
the music the characters the story it all just seems perfect it almost appears that it was written for the screen,positive
but the film is not about this even mr brilliant film,positive
i cannot believe how perfect this movie is this movie was great the characters the scene in which the movie was just amazing i really do not know what more i can say except that this movie was pretty much perfect i loved it,positive
everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film,positive
thats why youre here anyway would he care that his kids were watching them with him no come on my personal favorite though amazing what it always starts classic crap all the way,positive
mr the director knew exactly how to turn book into film and he has done so extremely well,positive
the show that is where did they come from about this plot if youre a dog you will have your own storyline,positive
i loved the movie it had a great story it told it just has so many great scenes,positive
i thought it was excellent then and i still do,positive
i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story,positive
i saw this film when it first came out and didnt know what to expect exactly theres not a bad song in the entire film but if you like a truly great film musical then this film is for you,positive
all well and good and sure not all perfectly done and indeed it may not be the last,positive
his performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie because of this we as viewers never really get involved with the story or any of its characters the cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller that will probably still please the fan of the genre,positive
it is great he is fantastic and he even gets better the older he gets there is lot of humor in this movie there is life in this movie this movie shows how life can be he is just great he deserves it so very much,positive
at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away,positive
ive never really been sure whether i liked this documentary or not,positive
from the get go you wont be able to look away and you wont want to dont believe me youll see what i mean,positive
okay you saw the film and i saw the film true,positive
the movie is a suspense film and its very good at that id love to know,positive
despite the fact that ive never seen every episode i still enjoy it very much for that reason its hard for me to say which episode is my favorite,positive
horror as it should be done first rate film making its not perfect but its well worth seeing,positive
but the movie was bad come on the tv series was much better,positive
i saw this movie on tv when it came out and never seen it again,positive
this movie is wonderful the writing directing acting all are fantastic,positive
which she does very very well and they do they do as if they needed any more in this film in its own truly unique way this might be the greatest film ever made,positive
you could do that then and i went back several more times before it left town i never saw the movie again,positive
i absolutely loved this film i remember how hard it was when john was shot,positive
this movie was pretty good s i also just loved the ending theme ten out of ten was my rating for this movie,positive
its a mystery to me why it isnt but it has never been released on home video too bad it works,positive
if you havent watched the movie yet but you do like comedy go out and buy or at least rent it and some would also say very british in a good way of course have fun,positive
the film has a great sense of humor about everything however hilarious,positive
if you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then this film will show you,positive
little did we know what we were about to experience,positive
i really enjoyed the performances of the main cast the film has a good look and the cinematography is also good,positive
there is a lot of deep thinking in this film,positive
this is worth watching again this a movie worth watching the movie has a good cast,positive
first off i never got into dr youll never want to take your eyes away nor miss a word of dialog it really is that good,positive
its perfect in every sense the story the script the acting the cinematography i have not read the book but i have seen comments that put down the movie because the book is always better it doesnt really matter,positive
so i rent it everything in it was so amazing the stories the actors the dark humor the music oh dont get me started on the music in this film,positive
no other movie has made me feel like this before and i dont feel bad no movie has ever done this to me before i dont know i truly dont know,positive
it does not lack crime the whole cast in fact is superb but he did it on a low budget,positive
this is a very funny movie the characters are interesting,positive
boy was i wrong well maybe not that high but its the only other romance i can think of that i like,positive
a dream is a wish and so this is love,positive
and more the best acting these days is being done in animation enjoy fun time for all,positive
i really liked the movie joe as a person mr,positive
i am still not sure what a i still dont know if s,positive
if you like period movies i cannot recommend this movie enough,positive
much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original first the voice actors do a great job,positive
rather enjoyed it i can see why this series has such a following what should i play i know i should get out more,positive
i thought otherwise but i still liked it because i didnt find it forced overall watch this movie with an open mind dont read the reviews before watching it,positive
however cover girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend,positive
great movies get watched more than movies that are not,positive
i enjoyed every bit of this movie this is one film you dont want to miss on the other hand it was a really really good movie very romantic,positive
what a fun movie experience finally its a feel good flick for the whole family,positive
this film was pretty good the plot was believable and i love the message,positive
i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving,positive
but its a very fun movie well people come on,positive
its an american classic or none you know the ending from the start but that doesnt matter dont rent this one buy it and buy it now,positive
the movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids,positive
great movie why but of course they are very stupid,positive
i highly recommend the film if you just want to have to good hours,positive
ill buy into it she is wonderful see this one,positive
guess what the show is good some of the viewers not so much i guess,positive
well i finally found out and i liked it a lot very good story line dont get me wrong its a pretty good movie too,positive
now i have seen the movie i can now move on with my life,positive
overall there really isnt anything new but it is still very fun to go through the game,positive
this movie is really funny and i love the songs,positive
once youve seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director,positive
why is this film so memorable and then the acting is just so amazing how long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story even if they were far from perfect because thats the way life is when you think about it,positive
so i have to say it is well worth viewing,positive
i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time buy a copy now it is a classic,positive
if you are reading this and have not already seen the film then it is too late thats when the simple message hit home,positive
so i certainly recommend this movie i believe that its always important to show the things portrayed here i hope that the movie eventually comes out on dvd,positive
in fact its quite obviously the best film of its kind,positive
but this movie and never ever there came a movie better than this but this movie got the best out of him,positive
this is definitely a girl movie its amazing to think that just a note can bring so many people together,positive
the mr if you liked the first film in the series this is definitely a sequel to see,positive
do not go by the other reviews this was a excellent movie is a fairly long movie but definitely worth it and while watching it definitely does seem long,positive
if you get a chance to see this film then do i cant wait to see it again and wish that it could be put on general release,positive
oh well why this movie wasnt huge is a mystery great comedy,positive
other than this i feel sure that this is a film you will really enjoy,positive
dont know if that was true hope it is not lost,positive
most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that,positive
i think this show is definitely the greatest show its definitely worth watching,positive
he gets dr people love him he gets the real dr,positive
let me tell you that it was well worth it the cinematography is wonderful she is one of a kind i could watch her films all day she really goes beyond beauty well yes she is great,positive
i watched it some years ago i think that the title is a hope about life,positive
pretty good for a sequel and i never even seen the first,positive
i watched the movie some years ago and i actually loved it but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on it was really good who im sure youll enjoy it,positive
quite a performance i think i guess it did sort of with fall for thats what we got one more time with dr fall at least it was for me,positive
good effects and acting make this movie a must see,positive
my wife and i would go see it loved it,positive
yes what after all is about to go wrong a lot and crime and of course there is more than just the first scene what to note s open who knows,positive
this film is amazing it has twist turns and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense or any sort of movie fan,positive
not to say this series is not good just not quite as good fantastic almost as many fantastic s as the doctor,positive
the music is great the love story is quite romantic the characters are quite well cast as well,positive
half the people involved with it are now dead moving right along,positive
my mother once told me that true love is just not real come on lets play the game the right way the only way i am gay myself and being gay is not easy even though you love a woman s,positive
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time,positive
i know what im talking about you will love it so check it out thats how it works in real life you can too,positive
after seeing the movie i can see why the movie was not bad nor was it great the problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story as a kid i loved the movie,positive
so if you want to see a truly creepy horror film give this one a look,positive
i wasnt as interested in that there should be a sequel,positive
making this short and to the point this movie was great i loved it but its so funny and hilarious and has a great cast including some beautiful women watch it and have fun,positive
directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there,positive
i have always enjoyed the film not the best film ever put to screen but enjoyable but you do not need to be one to like this film,positive
this is one of the greatest films ever made its an all time classic its true he really doesnt know nothing the story feels real this is one deep movie this is one well acted movie and this is one hell of a story movies that make you think movies that take you beyond having to think it really is that good,positive
i even loved the message in the song i also thought the special effects were good,positive
i have been looking for this for years i have no idea whether it was ever released on video,positive
he would go on to a great career as action director himself,positive
we should not forget that this movie is not a documentary,positive
i think this movie is different apart from most films ive seen certainly didnt see it coming although its sad its worth watching i cant think of any movie that would be like this actors knew what they were doing,positive
really enjoyed this little movie ill also add that this film is far from boring very far,positive
i think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late,positive
this is one of the movies that get better every time you see them,positive
these things help make this film fun it does however have its down side,positive
this is very very realistic were she not this would have been a very short film for a time and always will,positive
now the movie itself i just meant what i said in the title because for the most part this movie itself is made by the music the acting while the movie and acting is pretty bad this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too,positive
why theyre kids and they act like kids would the plot was very predictable and but so what i felt it all in the end i loved it and would recommend it,positive
it is long dont wait for anything to happen and each character does so,positive
this is probably his best performance the music is great what else could i possibly say except for go and get this movie now,positive
when i went to the cinema i expected not much a wonderful movie with wonderful actors,positive
this is a great movie it is based on a true story hope everyone will enjoy it,positive
well im not sure i cant help but think he would have been wonderful,positive
i have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again all the characters are well portrayed,positive
but this one has it all but i dont think theyre going to understand it,positive
but whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess i love,positive
if you can find a copy of this i highly recommend giving it a watch,positive
why should a black actor be the black man on the stage perhaps then the reason is the same he never has been,positive
i would recommend anyone to look at this movie you will not be sorry it is well acted out so real and never a dull moment i would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best i have ever seen,positive
and read the novel first it makes the movie better,positive
to me that boy i thought was the special one because he was going in a home a true story very good imdb,positive
they made the situation just as bad definitely worth seeing,positive
but whats this youll have to see the movie and find out wont you,positive
a new low right i got to say this is one of his good leading roles overall a guy thing is quite funny and is all right this movie is all right,positive
i really liked this movie i am really happy that i saw this movie,positive
and yes this film is not perfect its funny modern and by all means not a masterpiece,positive
good on him the actress in the lead did a decent job this could have been a horror sex classic,positive
t t t t t t t t t whatever does hes a different man now,positive
so what else he tries to murder him youll probably enjoy it,positive
it was completely over the top but really good fun,positive
this is a film that was very well done release it so all can enjoy,positive
it took me years to come up with this movie and it was well worth it,positive
i liked this movie i recommend this movie the subject of the movie is the reason for the rating,positive
red eye is one of the best movies in a long time the story is new and different the acting is just brilliant and you get the feel for the people in the movie i just love how the movie was just so well done and it never gets boring nothing more and nothing less its a excellent thriller overall i enjoy red eye so much that i can watch it over and over again great movie,positive
especially horror movies a s it is definitely one great movie you should too,positive
i absolutely loved this film and i cant wait to see it again,positive
i found this movie hilarious give it a try and then again later in the movie youll understand when you get there,positive
but theres more it is a powerful and memorable moment,positive
even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him,positive
this film features the famous line you can dream when the war is over,positive
more im not sure what but the writers should be able to come up with something everyone good and bad works well together check it out,positive
it both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with,positive
obviously we were wrong love may come from where you dont expect it and maybe dont want it we are still gay end of story,positive
this is decent funny and entertaining all in all i liked this movie it is not one of their best ones but i liked it,positive
i told every one to see this movie i just hope more people see this movie because i know that they will fall in love with it too,positive
while this film might not be the next evil dead hell who knows maybe it will it has only been out for a year it is worth a look all in all this film is much better than many if not all of the low budget horror films out there,positive
but sure everyone can see a film in their own way,positive
dont we already know what really happens in real life i know,positive
then were wrong its certainly got the feel of who goes there even more than the but then again who does enough said,positive
this is just my all time favorite movie nothing special money is not important you dont need money to get what you need if you need something it will just come to you if people would realize that the world would be a much better place whatever you do dont do it for the money,positive
it was fun to see them in this i didnt know they were going to appear,positive
this movie is wonderful i can watch it again and again,positive
i loved it but like i said earlier if you really get the plot this is not a bad movie,positive
this movie is brilliant and after to watch it again youll find even more,positive
the acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure well dumb,positive
yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable this film is special get it now,positive
i find it hard to believe that this movie has such a low rating,positive
its sure to please his fans and even create some new ones out of,positive
it is definitely slow but is well worth the watching,positive
im not sure if ive never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it its hard to say which one is my favorite also i really loved the theme song,positive
in my mind this is still one of the best if not the best sci fi films ever made,positive
there is always the mother telling you what to do or not being the kind of mother you want to be,positive
my wife and kids was and still is the best comedy series on tv ever made my wife and kids was a comedy the whole family could watch and you dont get that very often isnt there anything we can do to make it happen again we would do anything to have that comedy show on again brilliant comedy excellent stuff,positive
theres not a moment action cut or line that doesnt have everything to do with the theme realistic human performances from all the actors not a hand out and he did something about it just a thought,positive
this is done very well and makes the movie very special i guess you can say i liked this movie if you cant tell,positive
i saw this a good while ago but i just cant get over it,positive
the thing i loved most had to be the music i did not only enjoy the music i also quite enjoyed the cast,positive
from the moment the movie starts to the moment it ends you can feel how beautiful this movie is a great story a great movie do whatever you have to do and watch this movie,positive
the actors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends,positive
its obvious that i love this movie let us not forget this important piece of the movie,positive
i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else sometimes both at the same time it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it,positive
poorly filmed brilliant anyway or because of it for sure,positive
another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation,positive
a moving and well acted film with a great cast,positive
in short i had no idea what it was well it was both,positive
i was having just about the worst day of my life but its really so much more and of course theres also as far as the romance goes this is just perfect oh hell time to watch this movie again,positive
i dont know why there are some people who hate this movie so,positive
oh well it could have been much worse and it often was hollywood,positive
i had problems all through out high school and id rather not get into that i want my kids to watch it one day,positive
no one else could have done it i doubt whether it will ever be tried again and why should it,positive
the movie wouldnt be so interesting were there only the woman highly recommend,positive
we are made to imagine that this must have been the case,positive
but is it too late well close enough its message is more than real a must see,positive
did i understand every scene did everything work in the film perhaps not make it a party,positive
first of all i dont understand how she wanted to try for the boys team it was like this was the only team they know,positive
the cast was hilarious and cool at the same time shes very funny and a really good actress as well now im a fan i loved it,positive
i saw this film a few years ago and i got to say that i really love it the director i dont too many things about him and i dont care the screenplay is good thats for sure in just a few words i have to say about this movie that is weird strange even dark but its a good one i saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then i want to see it again and again the scenes the atmosphere the actors the story everything is good very good movie the end,positive
perhaps being seen and not heard needed to be made up for,positive
i love this movie it was one of my favorite movies the whole movie was done very well the ending is really good it was very original the acting was great,positive
i really enjoyed it watching its a same that i didnt know of it earlier,positive
its funny romantic and a classic i watched it when i was little and i still watch it now the acting is great and it never gets old,positive
we dont always get what we want right away but we find out we get what we need to to understand why we didnt get what we wanted you will get this once you see the movie,positive
i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one it will be so much more fun,positive
some of the set piece dance sequences so much is going on i didnt know where to look next,positive
i went into the straight story expecting a sad happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting these i got,positive
it was long but i didnt want it to end,positive
a very funny movie id like to see him do more of these low life roles,positive
this movie is about development it has it all and more,positive
this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film,positive
from the beginning of the movie with the first scene you expect more strong scenes thats why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end the performances are extremely good from all the five female characters this is where the movie turns interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth if not give it a try because its a very good and strong drama,positive
i seen this movie when it came out i thought what an average movie this is a great movie and great soundtrack,positive
if you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you it has everything you would want to see in a horror movie not as good as the evil dead but a close second,positive
its a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once,positive
you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself still the movie isnt that good thats probably what keeps this off tv most of the time,positive
however theres one problem he was your typical murder with the look that goes with it,positive
but it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre which is a thing that does not go for every single tv series so watch it,positive
this was such a beautiful film a must see one day and happen to run across it more movies should be made like this one,positive
i still do not have it but will one day,positive
i would like to see more this style of film making from him made it seem more real i am sure he got a film that he was happy with this stuff happens all the time,positive
i dont know how else to put it ill admit that we havent seen all of the other performances up for an oscar this year but that really doesnt matter s,positive
it is that funny shame you cant get it on dvd,positive
dont miss this film it is a whole lot of fun,positive
he has only had one woman in his life his wife,positive
this movie turned out to be pretty much what i expected anyway i wont get into it inside and out,positive
i absolutely loved this movie it also had a message,positive
t the story is not that good the acting is pretty poor too still this movie does work,positive
i have to say i totally loved the movie so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie,positive
at the time i didnt pay attention to how close this television production was to the book,positive
im acting school this was my favorite performance of the year by far,positive
in his world children are to be seen not heard so why would mr like mr,positive
until i saw it here i could only imagine what it looked like,positive
the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other,positive
there is a bit of blood the acting is amazing,positive
we all know this famous story crazy enough yet no thats just the beginning the story itself is amazing so out of this world and yet its so down to earth and believable what i like about it is the humor another thing is the characters and probably one of the only people he can actually stand is his lack of sense in direction then we have check out the series if you havent now,positive
i might just need to watch it again though for him alone this film is worth watching,positive
i have watched this film several times over the years and always find it an entertaining experience,positive
very well done and but i would say you need to pay attention to what is going on as it is easy to get lost when you start watching the movie dont do anything else all performances were strong directing and cinematography go watch it,positive
well after all this is rather a suspense story so youll have to see for yourself but its room for mr,positive
all the talent mr this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life all in all a brilliant film,positive
i am so happy not to live in an american small town to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself,positive
i used to watch this show as a child and i loved it the animation wasnt the best,positive
but theres a but hell ask himself whos this guy,positive
i cant be done there also are some good sound effects to help some of the dramatic scenes i enjoyed this movie more on the second viewing than the first just dont feel stupid if you cant make sense of a few things,positive
this is truly an art movie it actually has a lot of art in it go rent it,positive
it leaves me no up to go to almost it is a single shot that would be worth an entire film in short see it im sure youll see it again and again,positive
i look forward to seeing it again even at my age,positive
the audience cant be sure of this either until the very end of the film,positive
some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film,positive
its creepy in a good way i dont know to tell the truth i dont,positive
this is the best show ever no matter what you say so what,positive
he wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh he wants to help and love and give it makes you think of how we live our lives and why we live our lives this film at least is a must see,positive
both films are similar in their dream like quality if you can find it watch it you wont be disappointed and if you do find it let me know so i can get a copy too,positive
but for whatever reason i really liked this film no was it a bit predictable yes and so what it was still a really nice movie go rent it,positive
this movie is excellent very very wrong by the end of the movie nothing was as it seemed and a few people are dead and a few people are very rich i wont tell you who watch and enjoy,positive
if you can find the show check it out there are plenty of laughs to be had,positive
i am sure that this is one i will be watching for a long time to come i doubt it,positive
this is probably the second best of the death wish movies well that is something,positive
so many fine things to see talk about a dramatic end game,positive
so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look,positive
at the same time they learn things us parents didnt know until way way later,positive
interesting well yes slow sort of entertaining mostly plenty too many this is where the film doesnt work,positive
i love full house so much that i couldnt live without full house why did it end oh come on but it is better that we have those dvd to help us but i need those real ones to come up with another new episode are they still living in the same house,positive
it is not often you find that not so with this one this keeps you interested you also have to think a little bit but not too much once you think about it a little you can figure out what needs to happen but you really dont know for sure how it is going to happen,positive
i absolutely loved this film and for the last number of years,positive
the dvd has two sets of these out takes where as i t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids though,positive
if you want to see a true thriller rent this,positive
of course the premise was strange and fantastic at the time anyway,positive
this is seriously one of the best low budget b movies that i have ever seen the typical family man actually started his career with this movie,positive
as well as some nice drama the film has a great cast,positive
the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful,positive
this movie is well okay its not meant to be but its a big hit in my world this is a great movie for me,positive
you make a movie of course and why would it be the cast is good,positive
the best horror sci fi movie i have ever seen,positive
so by this time he was pretty well set in the role,positive
i am in love with this movie if you can find a copy of the film buy it,positive
this is one of the best films i have seen ever its great from the very beginning to the last second,positive
i just saw this film last night and i have to say that i loved every minute interesting all in all i thought this film excellent,positive
the two lead roles did an excellent job acting i mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister but everyone did a fine job there is a lot going on between the lines in this film,positive
i love it why and how did he become a water baby so i guess ill never know what the writer was thinking we watched that scene over and over there should be more films like this,positive
the movie because of this feels like it isnt telling the whole story yes the movie would just had been way better if it was not trying to be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere,positive
i just got this video used and i was watching it last night,positive
oh my god and that ones not mean to be funny but man is it well done and creepy,positive
it still a great and well worth to be seen movie mr,positive
even though he is making fun of small children it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the stuff,positive
now this is what a family movie should be i think mr and buy to own on video or dvd,positive
still even after having said this i would recommend giving new york i love you a view you will never know until you see it for yourself,positive
apparently this movie was based on a true story i move on then whats the point he says he loved the girl that he killed the acting is really good i still have no idea he was my main reason to see this movie though,positive
so she gets to know him and well i dont know how much i can tell you without giving it away so youre sure to like this movie,positive
go on give it a go you wont be disappointed,positive
and would watch it over and over the music was great modern english men at work it is definitely a classic like totally,positive
then again what do i know im only a child,positive
my husband and i watched this film last night for the first time,positive
to begin with there is an awful lot of comedy in this film that many viewers are not getting of course its a joke,positive
this one will keep you up all night thinking about what was real and what wasnt,positive
its well he left the show this is the one to get this is the real one,positive
ill start with all the things that i found not to be very good this leads me to my next point there are none though some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching,positive
this was a excellent movie this movie should be shown again on tv,positive
they are wrong very wrong you see yourself in another way that people see you to really understand the directors point of view you have to see it another time when you see this film try to understand the story and watch the background this film is one of a kind,positive
what does that have to do with this comment a lot if you are one of those people who say only country people love this movie he was believable and real s if you can watch this for what it is a true american love story then i recommend that you take it for what it is,positive
so come on imdb could you find out for us,positive
the acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast at any rate this was an amazing cast still more or perhaps not perhaps in fact i do understand it ever so well and that is what makes me really sad how sad and how predictable watch,positive
there arent any dead moments or cheap shots i was wrong they are wonderful together,positive
i so love this movie i love the music in the movie so great they kept the japanese music,positive
overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing,positive
i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films,positive
this is the most difficult movie i have ever seen,positive
i mean they are all very funny i cant wait to see it,positive
he was well cast in this there is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy i definitely recommend this movie the first thing my husband said to me after it was over was i want to see it again,positive
and it was funny but there were a lot of serious parts in the movie that i was not expecting but its still worth the money to see and i still found it to be almost everything that i expected,positive
the movie was fantastic i have a few friends who arent fans that enjoyed it and others who thought it wasnt that great,positive
its a feel good film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema and getting too personal shame,positive
and are also very fun to play with just on are own let alone to watch on a tv screen,positive
i hope it comes out on video because i will buy a copy rating,positive
how does it do this in this film it worked overall this film was brilliant,positive
in one season a based show and a bad one at that it truly gets better with age,positive
and many more until the final scene im still not sure how they did that,positive
i have no idea everything looks very real and live the acting was the real effect no one could have done better i guess its not too much to talk about could it get better no not at all,positive
i mean how else could i find out just watch this movie if you dont laugh then something is really wrong with you,positive
this film was full of suspense and was well directed the black and white effect made it a great mystery,positive
i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible,positive
this is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word a must see,positive
cant say this wasnt made well both the leads a brother sister team are excellent and memorable in their parts other than that as an entertainment it works well,positive
okay ill say it it certainly worked for me of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous,positive
still i liked the film and now own a copy of it this is a film that is out there well coming from a guy who doesnt know anything about it i can tell you that it is still an entertaining film i didnt really enjoy the film at first but the reason that i do recommend this film is for one reason only that is reason enough to see something that they put out,positive
i wont make this too long so you might find it boring or as said before a little over the top,positive
why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be,positive
to my surprise i found it enjoyable i like the voice acting especially dr,positive
i liked it just that i love it it isnt horrible but,positive
it must have been several years after it was released so dont know why it was at the movies but as a kid i enjoyed it he did a great job of playing the strong man it is definitely worth seeing there isnt a bad actor in the group,positive
unfortunately i was not able to see them in order as this is the third in the series,positive
this movie was really funny i hope this comes out on dvd,positive
seriously watch this movie its a good laugh and it will make you think,positive
it was pretty perfect though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that i recommend this to any music film fan youll probably learn something about film making,positive
lot sure you say like we needed that s maybe,positive
also id like to see more attempts like this one,positive
well simply a very entertaining fun film who is that boy that is perhaps not his son,positive
the actors all do a great job too all in all this movie really made me want to read the book,positive
and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it it was hilarious it is a must see film got it today on dvd well worth it,positive
very good stuff which only gets better from series to series,positive
he was cast in the lead s called for too much attention on the part of the viewer so isnt that what one would want,positive
this is not a hollywood film this is a perfect example of a what if film its not often that a film is able to come across that way,positive
i absolutely love this film and have seen it many times the performances are superb the film has everything,positive
save it for later this does not make him a bad cop i always liked the series better than the movies even though i saw the movies first why,positive
this is also no b movie i wont give anything away about the plot,positive
go see this movie rent it buy it watch it love it i know i did,positive
this movie took me by complete surprise i really liked this film i love all the characters in this film as well this movie may not be for every one but if you have an open mind i think you will love it,positive
so i knew the play well it was very funny i really liked seeing the characters being portrayed in a modern way,positive
on the one hand im happy its really fun and very well done,positive
but all is not as it seems what was he really saying,positive
it doesnt mean it will do that but it could,positive
i think that this is what what made the film good and although it was a little strange i actually liked the music in this film as well it simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well,positive
i loved this show so much it is funny and the actors are so good i am really sad that the show is over i would like to see her more this show really takes you in and makes you laugh,positive
and that only because he looks like one thats a problem that wont go away but the movie is really good so im sure the book would also the actors do good job one of the greatest scenes is in the end when mr,positive
this would have to be by far the greatest series i have ever seen,positive
high school but few find it easy to forget that was us up there on the screen like them not all of us made it what i wouldnt give to be young again,positive
this is the kind of movie the us doesnt make,positive
the performances are what make this film special a wonderful film,positive
she looks amazing she looks good and thats that sex violence and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours,positive
now today theyre back in also the final sequence is really strange and out of place,positive
there will be blood in this film and you will try to look away,positive
this is a hollywood film this film will not change the world,positive
a rather silly little film you just may love and last but not least mr if you do is worth your watch,positive
on the other the good thing about this film was there was some really good characters most of the actors played it out really well but that how it was all in all it was a great film very good to watch,positive
this film shows it as it is ive only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel,positive
i love this whole series and apart from the first and second movies this is by far the best,positive
you just dont know if he is going to go over the top and kill her at any moment excellent film,positive
and i do mean it at least obviously among the ones the many i know this movie very much worth watching is the movie is not perfect it isnt,positive
the kids were also great definitely check this one out if you get the chance,positive
is it a dream you will either love this film or hate it,positive
by the way the actors are really good and funny,positive
this is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting mr i think they should have it on tv again so a new audience can enjoy it wonderful performances mr i must see movie,positive
it can be taken away at any time so start living now writing a check is not enough,positive
how long were they can keep this if we were part what should they do,positive
you never know what is going to happen next you just dont know what going to happen next everything about this movie is great,positive
i had expected something quite different form the film that i actually saw go see it,positive
just make sure that you dont miss the first five minutes of the movie i could watch this over and over and i often do,positive
i couldnt wait for fall to get here to see was going to happen next,positive
on time and on budget at least for now a good guy he had to make do want her to be,positive
the performances are excellent throughout and the movie was very well cast no mr,positive
somehow the performances are excellent while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth,positive
this film is one of the best of all time certainly in the horror genre death at any turn horror should be believable and that is what makes the film enjoyable,positive
this is a hard show to watch it had some weird story lines and they spent to much time on characters that just didnt interest me if there is anything i will always remember about this show its them i wish it would never have happened i wish i had never watched it i do recommend it,positive
a but he cant get anyone who works with him to believe his story,positive
dont come back up here again play in better fight for your life in,positive
the original film is still very good however the tv series is much better,positive
it doesnt have a plot or story its not a documentary either some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read a must see it will change the way you view films,positive
i think not it doesnt have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films but that doesnt mean that this is a bad movie or does it i tried but i couldnt,positive
this film shows how it was all done however as someone said the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future,positive
the story is very typical and has been done before but the character development is very strong and entertaining it is a must see,positive
on this point the documentary did fairly well if youve seen the first such scene youve seen them all,positive
but overall i think its one of the better b movies yes its a low budget b movie,positive
this movie was the best movie i have ever seen i highly recommend this movie for everyone,positive
that doesnt make it bad just not something id go far but that isnt in itself bad,positive
s there are brilliant scenes in this film i thought he did his best i read in a book that this was one of her favorite films that is my favorite scene she was no big star but i thought her performance was really good i want to mention more about this film,positive
there arent any other lead actors in this movie this movie wasnt scary it also seems like a type of a movie when girls will enjoy more than guys but i did like this movie but for how it is this was just a pretty decent movie maybe anyone could like this movie this was on its own level,positive
s good entertainment and above average for this type of film watch it,positive
the storyline is pretty simple the acting in this film is decent overall this is a good family film,positive
you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie well you have to see it for yourself,positive
the first time i saw this movie i just thought what the hell i enjoyed this movie a lot want more ok dont even try to understand the story but why this movie needs one,positive
are the human people the ones who started the war,positive
of course not perfect but very enjoyable and funny how can you not like him,positive
the movie was very good while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didnt figure out who did it i have seen every actor whos played him,positive
it will be seen many times in the future im sure,positive
do not look for humor in this film there is none but movies as great as this make you wonder why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of,positive
i have seen this film before but there is always something new in it for me,positive
several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad they made it so good until i cant stop watching this all over again,positive
havent seen her in two years do i care not really maybe well make a go of it maybe not no i dont really care about anything any more ive done this too long i guess this is strange stuff the reason for the murder what does that mean,positive
his role and his acting is the best of the movie what i miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie overall its an entertaining western flick,positive
mr and if theyre arent really in love then whats the point down and this point is made when mr,positive
but despite this the episode was enjoyable and worth my time,positive
this is one of the great ones but then who else should have played him,positive
very funny stuff this movie has it all and is simply hilarious,positive
its hard to believe but this stuff really does happen,positive
where exactly the film goes from there youll just need to see for yourself,positive
this movie got better with time yes thats right imagine the times,positive
never taking itself seriously the film is over the top and yet isnt very unique nor does it go where no one has gone before its a boy meets girl boy leaves girl thing and in the end the characters are looking for love,positive
yes it was a little low budget but this movie shows love,positive
i could write more but its already been said here,positive
but i think of the three this one is the best,positive
this movie is an amazing comedy the script is too funny,positive
you read that right oh well a very cool movie,positive
every time i watch it i can get something else out of it,positive
this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies,positive
its perfect its worth seeing so far worth a look,positive
i was wrong no one has come back saying it was bad at the beginning it was a little slow,positive
or at least they dont seem to care this is as real as it gets,positive
i believe many of us have had that moment in our lives this is the premise of the movie the best of times again,positive
the writing is what really makes this show its a total classic,positive
i thought the movie was extremely funny and actually very interesting it is a very good film,positive
as i already say above whole cinematography was very good sorry for my bad english,positive
its a horror film and i thought it was exactly what it should be it all comes down to do you love horror films really love them if not youll hate it,positive
i couldnt find anything wrong with it nothing period the script is original great soundtrack i i will probably watch it again it is that interesting it makes one think i couldnt find anything wrong with it check it out my first review,positive
the whole three hours in my opinion were well worth it if you have the chance watch this amazing documentary,positive
and so it goes on and so on brilliant now i have a few problems with this film is it a good family film its hard but i know some will go see and fall in love this film,positive
wait yes i can and the violence oh the violence,positive
okay this movie is for certain people though either youll completely love it or you will totally hate it a good movie to rent and watch when you dont got anything else to do,positive
i think his performance in this film is the best of his career this movie is simply amazing and if you havent seen it run out and watch it today its brilliant,positive
time for a hit of three theres also an action scene for his fans,positive
i still enjoyed as much as i did the original though,positive
as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known the two leads always have to get together then this is for you,positive
it seems that way because of the form but the ending says it all in the end we never really know the truth and nothing is what it seems actually the rest of the movie is funny too do we really care if it does no,positive
and they sort of become friends then this is when the horror starts,positive
its by far one my favorite films this movie is just,positive
throughout this film you might think this film is just for kids,positive
no special sound effects so special side effects the camera work is excellent the music is oh so good i cant wait to get the soundtrack,positive
i really enjoyed this movie you will not be disappointed,positive
i really dont know i also really wanted to know what was going to happen when the after the end of the film happened ive not seen it before or since but i would love to what are you up to these day oh and do you have a copy of the film,positive
i did not see this film in the theater i have to stop and watch,positive
so what happens here he lives in a house with three women so watch out,positive
it is a very weird movie and nothing really comes together until the end in my mind that is not a bad thing,positive
this movie is horrible in a so bad its good kind of way you get the point although he isnt in the movie that much the few scenes are worth it t but he made this movie,positive
i was in for a surprise without working that hard,positive
but i find the story excellent too this film is brilliant,positive
i loved the show so much finally a show for everyone to enjoy i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one,positive
so i had even more reason to watch well i watched,positive
sounds funny and crazy but im the kind of guy which when he is interested he just cant stop this series is one of the best of its kind,positive
its great as a b film and the action sequences are a lot of fun to watch youll never see another film like it,positive
in fact i dont think ive ever liked him in anything ive seen him in i almost gave up then and there there are some funny parts in it definitely his best in my opinion,positive
but it really is the best way to film the story even though it took some getting used to,positive
i just thought this movie was so wonderful a must see if you like action,positive
we dont see it we dont have to see the gore,positive
a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming,positive
for some reason i always enjoy movies that people hate when i really dont think theyre that bad and this is one of those films,positive
on the whole this is a really good movie dont miss it,positive
this episode so far is the best of the series the story was told perfectly this was a great way to end the show guess well find out next season however great ending to the best show on tv,positive
man i never laugh so much this year and its pretty hard to make me laugh and oh boy she did a wonderful job they were both very funny most of the time,positive
i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers,positive
whether to buy it or not is up to you,positive
this was one of the few problems with the film,positive
it may not be an excellent hollywood movie but that does not matter,positive
it is not until the end of the very final scene that we realize that it is in fact about everything,positive
he was always the right man to do anything there are many classic moments in this movie all the true western fans will love this movie,positive
that was important because in the book and in the original movie the home is very much a character itself s,positive
if it had been a feature film and better quality it would have been perfect,positive
how are they supposed to see what theyre doing in there i have no love lost for that man boy can we say the word effect s,positive
the horror indeed however as they say the very thing that works for you can also work against you,positive
never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though this is not the greatest flick in the world but its not bad,positive
well im a few days late but what the hell surprise the film is actually pretty good why,positive
if you dont want to read this kind of review then go well enough of my stupid personal story let me tell you about the movie at the end of every day he goes home to his mother he never went to school until later in the film this is a must see for the whole family by yourself or if youre someone who just wants a great drama never,positive
so i was completely in love with this movie although the subject isnt brought up in the film,positive
sure the effects were not great but they were also not horrible either,positive
and this is one of his better films this film was very well written very well put together and very well shot no mention of a rich background but the acting in general was top of the line finally the soundtrack not her best work how can one go wrong,positive
this movie is different i believe it to be her best performance yet,positive
ill say no more youll have to watch the movie which is quite fun to watch,positive
life goes on we all went to school with kids like these,positive
i only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series then they might make some great war movies note,positive
new york city was the place im not going to go through the plot here what plot this film is not about plot etc the sound score is even better the editing is only so so the acting is above average i love you i love you i love you the short run time is one a,positive
much less on film its probably time you did so,positive
they never look straight nor talk each other but they never forget each other,positive
the four films our mr the star of the series was dr dr,positive
it is the best movie on acting i have ever seen it is sometimes said that they do not act they live it you can really see this in this movie all people should see this movie,positive
what surprised me about this film was how quickly it was made after the war,positive
i love this movie and for a low budget horror film the effects and such are quite good and i also love the theme music it goes well with the film check this one out,positive
we look forward to seeing many more films from mr,positive
this is an enjoyable movie its very realistic to the wonderful world of music ive been there and done that very enjoyable movie,positive
this is one of my favorite films of all time,positive
when i brought the film i was not sure if i knew enough about the series to get it boy was i wrong,positive
and sometimes we should give them a had and help them to the very end,positive
ive just seen it it would be wonderful if they made the entire movie,positive
i cant understand what it is that fans of the genre didnt like about this film it was truly a lot of fun the special effects were wonderful i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case both films that i thought were terrible people liked it for its special effects,positive
you just know she doesnt take any b if you havent seen this i highly recommend that you do,positive
it has a great cast and all the actors did a great job,positive
this movie is not for everyone fans of sci fi films who dont take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie,positive
first of all i would like to say that i really liked this game,positive
i thought this movie was perfect for little girls most little girls would like this story even though there is the thought of death in it,positive
otherwise it was actually quite entertaining and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played,positive
is a funny but strange film i will go into the plot later on it makes sense the whole movie is strange here we have some of the best actors out there see what i mean the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming but that doesnt matter this is a strange funny and entertaining comedy i love most of the actors so really how could i not recommend it,positive
i think this movie is well done and realistic this is a movie i will recommend for others to watch high quality realistic story and movie,positive
i look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future well done,positive
this was a great movie i really enjoyed it and so did my friend they all did a great job in my opinion,positive
it is not a film for everyone this is a fine fine film,positive
while they may be home now you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be see this film,positive
mr s mr another very nice thing is that mr as you can tell i am a real true fan of this film it meant a lot to me s it is the best dvd as far as quality i have ever seen the soundtrack is great,positive
why should anyone care the acting is great for the most part as well,positive
if it already sounds weird to you then you are right because it is but then,positive
almost everything about red eye is above average including the suspense the acting and the direction the screenplay isnt as strong as everything else though if you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed,positive
i simply love this movie please try to see this movie in its original form not the terrible full screen,positive
hate to see it end wouldnt miss it for the world its the best reality show thats ever been on television,positive
shows us something i had not seen since his last film it is powerful stuff everything in front of the camera is anything but simple i cannot recommend this film highly enough,positive
at points the film makes you believe everyone is going to end up dead,positive
it may not be for everyone because it makes you think,positive
nothing that appears on t too much money time and work is put into the production of a t i would love to see her stand up,positive
most people i know dont have that kind of time especially so few will end of reading it,positive
if you want to know what happens in the film then go see it this film works mr perfect i can go on and on the real star here is the brilliant screenplay,positive
it was on one night and i thought oh well why not the music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or miss,positive
its hard to say what it would be like on video,positive
i loved the storyline and the actors it has a little of everything i highly recommend it i also wanted to make sure i didnt miss anything that was in the book but kept out of the movie it has become my favorite movie,positive
no one can tell me when i am in love for if someone did i would not believe him anyway for no one but me would know on another note how will i deal with my own certain death,positive
although i have not seen absolutely all of their movies i really enjoyed almost every one i did see,positive
his part is really a bit part in this movie,positive
given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room is it any surprise what happens next,positive
truly a boy directing a movie about a boy i did think this one was a bit too long,positive
it has a well written script the characters are memorable s,positive
i feel there is no need to tell you anything more unless of course,positive
i own every copy of this movie and have read and re read the original,positive
word has it that if you have the money he can help you things start of well but they still cant get out the movie is really good because it doesnt let on whats going to happen and its interesting all the time i couldnt believe the ending though,positive
its the best action movie ive seen since live free or die hard,positive
okay i love this movie i watched it over and over again you keep thinking its one person then another then back to the first person then another person it is so suspense full you want to fast forward your tv to the end to see who it is but who did it i love the acting they have a lot of great talent in here if it comes on tv watch it,positive
this is a good dark film that i highly recommend,positive
i was into the movie right away go see this as soon as possible i believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level,positive
the best of everything just what is the best of everything it is different for everyone but for most of us it is love who knows,positive
that is finally up to you but in my opinion this is a very funny movie,positive
all four are great actors and add to the entertainment,positive
i dont think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick people who didnt like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all dont expect something from a movie that it isnt i still recommend people to watch the movie,positive
i truly felt for him could you imagine doing that,positive
what i got was something better i didnt hear anything bad about it now i know why this movie starts up as sort of a comedy then during the last half of the film it quickly becomes something else each character gets just enough screen time and you care about what happens to each of them i loved every second of it definitely also because i read the plot for it and i think it sounds really good im looking forward to it i cant wait for both i highly recommend this film you must see it now,positive
i would really like to get a copy of the song anyway the cast is great the movie is worth watching,positive
this movie is probably my favorite movie of all time the rest of the cast is amazing and the film is really really funny youll laugh all the way through,positive
or is it ok but has good editing and dialogue definitely worth watching,positive
watching this movie makes me feel dumb but its a great movie you wont be the same after you see it,positive
but if you can look at it as a film where almost nothing funny happens then youll have a really good time,positive
if you are a romantic you will love this movie this is a movie that i always enjoy to see again and again,positive
i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid it wasnt weird to me i would love to see it again and hope i wont be disappointed the acting i thought was strong,positive
he is most certainly not the man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didnt,positive
very i liked watching this film when i was the child,positive
if you dont believe just watch the movie dont miss this film,positive
there are weak points though you really cant care less about him,positive
she wants to tell the truth and she never meant to run away from the crime scene but is it worth telling and having the whole town hate you for it you feel for her even though you know what she did was wrong in the end i wanted to see more of her,positive
not as easy as you may think but then the difficult bit i cant say what its about go see yourself,positive
in fact everyone in the cast does a good job just a thought true crime shows its director in a good light true crime could easily not have worked but it does ok i think it is an entertaining story worth seeing,positive
i still have yet to talk to anyone who has seen this,positive
it was a very interesting unique different and funny story i didnt know quite what to expect when i watched it now that ive seen the movie i have to read the book,positive
i did like it but for fans of gore there isnt really much of it none really in fact,positive
what can i say this is one of the most perfect films ever made,positive
this is a wonderful movie and i still love it i havent even read the book and guess what i dont care but theres no doubt that i will always love this movie,positive
youll either love or hate this film but give it go,positive
second they cant die oh they also come out at night,positive
scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing,positive
so maybe things will go better for him in the future,positive
this movie is such a moving amazing piece of work i have read the book as well but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life,positive
they both are in love with him but is this a good idea the novel was written something after the first war,positive
the animation is horrible but yes thats the point most of these stories completely lack any kind of point,positive
this is not especially well written the songs are not memorable they are believable worth seeing if you dont mind black and white good ending,positive
what is he supposed to be he was a kid in the past and the future this movie had a lot of problems man what a piece of crap strange very strange this movie will mess with your mind and its not very scary why was he where did what was the,positive
easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time,positive
this film is one to go out of your way to see,positive
a buy it or dont but the message is still there,positive
its an american film but its not a us film i liked the music but what do i know the characters were easy on the eyes i dont remember anyone in the film saying those words and it should have an s,positive
this movie was much better than i expected but its basically cheesy still entertaining however,positive
watch this movie yet they do come off funny at times,positive
this is my kind of film but it is also a dark comedy while i see it mostly as a horror thriller there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedy it leaves the viewer a lot to think about,positive
finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too,positive
thats the beginning of the greatest horror thriller film ive ever seen the acting is great the best performance is probably given by the dog whos just amazing well think again you havent seen it all until youve seen this the movie is without doubt one of my if not my favorite ive seen it several times but its just as good as the first time i saw it,positive
it was more real because you saw them through the relationship rather than the whole movie be about them getting together all in all i would definitely recommend it,positive
definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh a must see for cheesy movie fans,positive
why arent more british movies like this look out for it ten out of ten,positive
who knows its in two parts and oh so great see it now,positive
this movie just felt very true to life there were a lot of scenes that involved the family well done,positive
this is what the musical genre was made of nothing else needs to be said definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed,positive
bad acting bad direction bad looking woman bad sets bad cinematography bad sound and bad sex scenes how dumb is that,positive
to me a matter of life and death is just that simply the best film ever made,positive
i really loved seeing this movie even though hes not in it for very long the movie wouldnt be the same without him,positive
try and find a scene in which she doesnt appear,positive
i think this film is a perfect example of the of the power that drama has the cast was amazing it should be seen,positive
but this movie is not about these guys no he too wants the money for himself and any gun can play,positive
at any rate the director went all out there so he gets points for that how long have you been living under a rock,positive
how many reviews of this film will i have to write before i get it right i got a wife and two kids whos got time for a two hour movie,positive
her very beautiful looks help of course but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress playing a good part,positive
its hard not to love her in anything shes really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era,positive
its always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change the way this story is told isnt however the best it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who,positive
well that would be telling but they are just great,positive
but in good earth she shows that she can really act like hell if you people are saying that she doesnt act well in this film you are not looking if you get a chance to see this film watch it,positive
yes the special effects arent the greatest but there are definitely some good ones here does,positive
all in all theres little not to like about this film very well worth the time to watch it,positive
oh well i cant imagine watching it on its own however,positive
what do i mean now for the film this documentary has something that i dont expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film i got nothing more to say,positive
this movie is based on the novel island of dr,positive
i absolutely like this film a lot then you might like this work of art or do we,positive
its good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast,positive
s that killed his daughter be sure to give this one a try you will not be disappointed,positive
she really doesnt like the work but its a living give this one a look,positive
it is a simple film but it is indeed a great film look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life,positive
action comedy suspense this movie has it all just an overall good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different,positive
i never seem to write a review on imdb unless i am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is out of,positive
and this is all in the first half hour first let me say that while it was not always easy to follow i still had a major good time with this movie care was taken here and it shows it shows,positive
all good films great films think movie makes you think,positive
this short will bring lots of laughs and dont miss the credits as they are playing at the end,positive
i will wait she will come when she can or when she wants to,positive
i remember when i first saw a video of his,positive
having a group of three is usually simple back in those days that really makes him good,positive
what film was he looking at it is fantastic it is too bad mr one can only guess as to his reason,positive
give this one a chance if you have some time to waste,positive
even if you dont think this would be your kind of film watch it i certainly was,positive
right good times not in this case though the acting was very well done,positive
the acting is really really good the supporting cast in short is excellent,positive
i decided to wait until the next day then i read more about the film on imdb and was sad to learn that mr,positive
the characters are real they are not hollywood and their stories are real,positive
this is actually excellent and the best possible film version that could be made a,positive
a pretty good movie until the end ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending,positive
but will that matter in the face of a killer who wont let up,positive
this movie is extremely good stuff and one would never guess it was low budget i highly recommend this movie,positive
its probably not the type of comedy for everyone but what is this movie needs your full attention the humor is mostly in the dialog,positive
the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least,positive
i loved this movie best movie i have seen in a long time i use them all the time i love this movie,positive
or so they thought this movie takes place about a year after the second this movie has it all then theres the actors this movie isnt scary but is is hilarious out,positive
he cant see anyone no one can see anyone is it not who we are fighting that age old history question but rather why are we fighting,positive
the quality level of the movie is like a good tv series all in all i enjoyed it,positive
and you see the people maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house youll try to get away but you cannot maybe youll end up like them it has beautiful people,positive
this is one of the best movies ive ever seen,positive
i loved this film i thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget,positive
and the rest you better see it from the movie one way or another its the story of lady death,positive
the film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film,positive
thats exactly why this movie is so scary thats what the story is all about at one point dr now hes not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him this film came right on time actually im not at all saying this is a masterpiece but its a nice change the rest of the cast does good work too,positive
they only want to go back home fun and more of it family fun the special effects are quite good you will not be disappointed,positive
or at least dont realize how close they are i cant wait for her next one once you start watching this you really want to see it through,positive
basically the show was never given any chance typical hollywood,positive
even though i think movies like this are very hard to come by enjoy it,positive
this movie keep it up is there a sequel in the works,positive
this movie was amazing all in all this movie left you feeling great and happy especially those that love rock music you have to see this movie if you love rock music,positive
just watch it dont read what i write but watch the movie instead,positive
we are not stupid we know theres a novel behind this great performances the ending is truly moving great movie the last last scene was very sad,positive
the music score by b mr excellent acting as always but no i will watch this film again easily s,positive
it may seem too good to be true but thats whats so amazing about it i have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews,positive
the second episode is just very funny very silly and very enjoyable,positive
everyone is completely believable many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them,positive
he is also a rock simply i would die for that man he will go himself he doesnt leave anyone behind thats why i probably wasnt a fan,positive
the actors work well i think one good thing is there is no memorable person they are a team go on give it a go,positive
modern original romantic story its not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her,positive
they are obviously wrong for each other this much is clear,positive
this movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like its an actually documentary,positive
this was by far the best war documentary ever made,positive
i really liked this documentary movie and know that viewers will see and learn things they didnt know before this movie is truly one of a kind pretty amazing stuff,positive
here theres a lot of this stuff all three movies are great,positive
a truly moving picture s s open and with no big movie stars the story is somehow more believable,positive
this was a great movie s and it was worth all the money i gave for it this movie is one of the best movies for children i have ever seen maybe the best its so great,positive
as a sequel this is not a bad movie i found it more entertaining it seemed like it was shot documentary style i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters it has some of the same great music from the original which is great the acting again was pretty decent for the most part though like i said some of it seemed over the top overall though i thought this was a pretty sequel,positive
she really does give a great performance in this film,positive
i expected a good movie what i got was an even better movie the movie works because the actors play their parts perfectly he just was the funny parts are hilarious i totally recommend this movie,positive
i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy i have ever seen the thought that maybe they wont get together this movie was well written directed and acted,positive
you had to have been there i still remember it as wonderful and wish i had been a little older,positive
it makes you happy if not come right out in the dark you are back in the beginning of time those who are not happy with themselves should not write comments,positive
this movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in,positive
what a wonderful premise i love this show live with it and its still a lot of fun to watch,positive
when people say the book was so much better theyre usually wrong anyway what they are really trying to say is the book was so different,positive
what we have here is an action movie with a point of view and it is certainly never dull,positive
i didnt know what to expect really there is no way there was a better movie made that year or any other year for that matter,positive
nor is a typical drama or suspense movie which leads to my final comment,positive
i saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since i have the dvd i can still watch this movie today it is excellent,positive
i think this is a great classic monster film for the family class what else can i say,positive
love the tv show wish i was there acting in with them making the best of what you have is a good thing a well,positive
if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot then this film is not for you thats really about all the plot there is,positive
home room was a great movie if youve ever had drama in your life i wish i could find more movies like that one all in all i thought it was a great movie the more you watch of it the more you become part of it i loved it so much,positive
this was a scene that could have come straight out of the horror classic evil dead that is all fine in the beginning,positive
it does seem to get a bit long towards the end,positive
and for those of you who dont get it its supposed to be funny,positive
in the end this one makes for a rather good suspense thriller,positive
if you get a chance watch the making of feature on the dvd,positive
perhaps the reason i liked it is because i havent seen the original this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original there were a few things i liked about it this was a great role for him i had no idea this was the case when watching it and then theres the ending i am not sure how i feel about the ending i do not think however that this was a great film it was better then average to me but far from great,positive
and he does it i might add without a lot of help from his male actors i,positive
in other it was much worse first of all theres the music it doesnt get any worse than that get out of here you also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this at least half the characters seem like real people and mostly real people you would like to have around in fact i was surprised that there was no talent show scene,positive
i was right and to anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance to it is well worth it,positive
the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act,positive
its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name but once viewing it however being unique as it is boy who one day may save the world or maybe not,positive
probably more ill than we know its a shame dont you think,positive
however despite this this is still a very enjoyable film,positive
this movie is a perfect example of his work its not really a movie with a story to it in a sense of having a beginning middle and end in it all different stories are being told with lots of class though some of them are of course more interesting and realistic than the others,positive
who can ask for more but well worth it maybe too young,positive
i have seen this movie just once and im looking forward to see it again and again one of her best performances ever try to see it,positive
thats not what i got we get the expected sex jokes and scenes but for once theyre actually pretty funny then the jokes stop and things get very dark what more can you ask for also it has a great soundtrack,positive
i can not wait to see what your next feature will be ill be with you all the way,positive
i liked this a lot you just get into it,positive
apparently a lot of people liked this movie he usually has something funny to say throughout the movie,positive
this is one of my favorite films ever the story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good,positive
the use of music is particularly excellent in the last third of the movie,positive
after a season or so mr now back to our story,positive
it had everything i wanted in a show suspense action mystery great plot and a great cast of characters my whole family loved to watch the show when i watch tv now i only watch good shows so right now thats not watching a whole lot of tv i hope theres a lot of people out there that feel the same way,positive
at times i really wonder when i look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than i have ive just seen it and liked it not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film and no and while that doesnt work out perfectly at least i think it works quite good the opening scene is really special,positive
while the t then there are the songs of course,positive
i loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end,positive
the lines the acting if anyone know where i can find it,positive
i was a huge fan of this show and still am i watch this movie now and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw it if you have not seen it rent it you wont be sorry,positive
good movie all elements of a good movie was there story actors script and direction no question about it is a low budget film but i liked it more than many big budget films she is an excellent part to the film,positive
chance is the word but it doesnt end there now red is so much more than a story youll have to watch the movie and wonder,positive
all that said it is the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching,positive
after all its all in the family and the film sure doesnt take itself too seriously,positive
all in all i enjoyed it so i give it a out of,positive
it had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough,positive
i loved the characters and storyline but most of all the great actors,positive
alone with the alone excellent tv film all in all i highly recommend,positive
they didnt give him many lines is there a reason for that it makes one wonder what they see in each other they could have told the story in two hours the story is good the character actors were great,positive
until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school they is a lot to say about this movie all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys made,positive
i have not read the novel from which the film is based on,positive
i thought the game was really great and loved it the game is simple,positive
of course not what do they know theyre just kids,positive
it sounds it to me i would love to know,positive
we got to see them experience a few good times something they didnt have very often i wish they would bring the show back i dont think a movie or a new show would work especially without the original cast,positive
however its a good movie and the acting is good too well see the film for the whole story,positive
i say bring it back i know all of the actors would come back,positive
cant find what your looking for i thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie good for the whole family it was brilliant to say the least in my opinion its a must see movie and i dont think that about a lot of movies believe me when i say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that,positive
i was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part movies this movie is definitely worth seeing and take something with you when you leave that cinema,positive
to attempt to end the year on a high note,positive
if you ever ever have the chance to see this movie see it its worth it i dont know why i dont know why i dont know why i dont know why i dont know why,positive
plus this is one of the best low budget horror films i have seen in a long time the direction is very good there is a lot of gore the acting is very good for a low budget film rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one,positive
the movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy,positive
this movie is a great movie however it is as most movie highly predictable,positive
but one might add that that was probably not too difficult the plot is not very important this is the beginning of the second half,positive
i say this is worth watching i love it i find it hilarious which is fine by me watch enjoy love,positive
you have to give it a try my father the hero i love you,positive
the actors play it straight and dont play down to kids,positive
i thought that it was well acted and it really made me feel for the characters,positive
this must be something new but i really dont have anything else to say,positive
however its still good and if you get the chance its definitely worth seeing,positive
basically i thought it was totally great well this one really is totally different need i say more just see it,positive
does anyone know where i might get a copy of it,positive
i just got it and it is a great movie i loved it i still cant believe i got to meet him,positive
can the series keep it up at this level lets hope so,positive
its my life my all times favorite movie i follow this movie,positive
but there is more to the picture than he is seeing,positive
the story is so cool and cant wait to read the book,positive
maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five buy and enjoy,positive
i didnt know what to expect from this i didnt know that they could act,positive
i wasnt disappointed either another scene where the same thing happens i highly recommend it,positive
first of all i must say that i love this film i like what i saw,positive
i wish it would come back for one more season,positive
i wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better you might want to wait for the dvd on this one but if you get a chance to see it give it a shot,positive
i kid you not hilarious thats how some of the best comedy should be played straight,positive
got all that now lets get into it im not that way everything seems okay what do you want to know let me guess but shes a good girl yes shes not a bad girl no you know what happens next now on to the sex at least she can do drama somewhat id give her an a all by herself,positive
hell its probably the best action film to come out this year a,positive
ok of course not well guess what for those of you who find him annoying that is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you,positive
this is a must see documentary i want you see it for yourself it will make you care about the world and our children,positive
this is a must see but even then its enjoyable,positive
s are they going to get away its a good film,positive
the show is really funny nice theme cast is really very important for viewers to like it,positive
ive ask friends in the past about this series and they have no idea what im talking about and think its some kind of weird dream ive had i seem to remember that there used to be a break of some sort in the middle of each episode no idea why would love to see it again,positive
i could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it t overall a wonderful film maybe even better,positive
thriller is brilliant the song itself is excellent the special effects are amazing for its time,positive
he had a great time maybe not quite as fun but it was beautiful,positive
i really in enjoyed watching this movie like most of the people that watched it i wasnt sure that i was getting sister act however this was not really comedy i do think that it is worth a chance,positive
where do i begin the sequel however is to say the very least enjoyable i enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie the animation was kind of scary at times it just seemed scary to me also where the hell was lady but all in all i liked it no like it,positive
we think that they could not have done the job any better s there is no wasted time either all the screen time is used to move the story along,positive
as for the characters its a horror film youre not really expecting anything memorable,positive
theres not much new here its just done well i know i know,positive
hes not bad in the film as for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out,positive
before i comment about this movie you should realize that when i saw this movie i expected the typical crap horror b movie and just wanted to have fun,positive
its all there youll need them i know that i did,positive
what to do call the police no he needs time to think this out this film is much better than im making it sound,positive
and the music is fantastic you will not be disappointed,positive
what its not that hard to film in a car second the story isnt very good there are a lot of things wrong with it,positive
yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them,positive
i absolutely loved this show definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children i recommend this show to anyone,positive
a light is seen moving towards them is a mystery but why t s the power game,positive
i love this movie you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them,positive
this is all in a days work i dont know i liked the low budget style i liked the acting a lot,positive
the cast is great too now of course he is going a way too far but sure the boy can act,positive
i heard about this video and knew i had to have it,positive
now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well i really love the show because it is a show you can watch with your family also when the kids on the show have a problem they can always open up to their family for help kids should be watching more shows like full house instead of half the mess on tv now a days i also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth,positive
from the start the movie made you laugh a classic,positive
this would definitely not have been my kind of movie but my husband saw it on tv and said it was really good it is only later in the movie that it all comes together or bad woman a good show,positive
is that not what films are supposed to be about,positive
i still liked it though you expected something more and you got nothing the thing about this movie is it is good but it could have been so much better the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere still this is a good movie that could have been much much more,positive
i thought this movie would be dumb but i really liked it well so what i wouldnt care to own the movie and i would love to see it again,positive
t i was a fan for life from that moment on one of dr she should have been told to stay at home,positive
it became like nothing anyone had ever seen before on the other hand its a very interesting documentary about film by the people who make it,positive
anyway i watched it at the time and didnt get it his movie career never really took off as expected but of course he later found success on tv,positive
wasnt sure what to expect from this film hes a mess and plays being a mess very well cant ask for more than that brilliant,positive
but what are they i do recommend this one if you want a simple fun and above all enjoyable watch,positive
it was the best i have ever seen if you like funny scary movies you have got to see this one,positive
i would recommend this series to anyone whether you are interested in war or not,positive
will the series go on video i would love to see how it ends the writing was pretty good also i am so sorry to see it go,positive
but what really surprised me were the reviews that came after my word,positive
reading all the comments here i have a lot to look forward to whatever happens to her it isnt enough oh no,positive
it also goes by fairly quickly for its less than ten minute run its a must see if you havent seen it as a kid but if you have it might still be worth another look,positive
that was a great gore scene when i left the theater i just loved it and i couldnt believe it was real a sure out of bring it on,positive
the film is more about the characters than about the events,positive
as soon as i heard about this film i knew i had to check it out after that thats when i knew i had to see it no then get lost well actually it kind of is a zombie well ill just let you watch this incredibly unique flick if you thought anything i said here was interesting by all means check this film out,positive
she has a political career in mind for her son,positive
we were really looking forward to number two we were not disappointed perhaps but if it does i could really care less,positive
my favorite show of all time it was well written funny except when it it wanted to be serious and just a great show overall but its what ill always remember her by too cool,positive
that being the new years party sequence the music like in any great film is a character of its own ok back to the performances,positive
excellent cast story line performances totally believable he knew what his true course of action had to be,positive
what like what was he thinking its really small a classic,positive
it was great okay okay so the acting wasnt the best but i thought the performances were still overall great also you could tell that the actors were having fun while doing this movie get over it i thought this movie was going to be stupid but it was really funny overall i love it,positive
red is a fantastic film but watch it again with the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind you must think as you watch you must see not simply look wonderful movie,positive
second of all you need to do this once youve watched it three times however youre not going to stop there,positive
i love it a lot and its one of my favorite films,positive
in fact i think part three might just be the greatest or at least my favorite one of the series so far,positive
best movie ever the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid,positive
in fact the entire cast was very good everyone is very believable its a short movie just under an hour and a half,positive
what a great surprise ok or small children my girlfriend and i both loved it i cant wait to get the dvd,positive
these girls is the story about three best friends from a small town i think the quality i liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic go figure the script was very strong the acting was very good for the most part i thought all the three girls were great i think with what little budget mr,positive
no but this actually is it and theres a whole lot more to it than just the action theyre kids theyre kids,positive
i say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all,positive
the setting was interesting strange but interesting but they all didnt matter,positive
dont get me wrong i did find the movie enjoyable,positive
i liked the movie so much that i had to own it i absolutely loved this movie for its lack of the same never wanted to do so when watching this movie,positive
if you live in a big city buy it or rent it it is worth the effort to find a,positive
the movie seemed a little slow at first i enjoyed it,positive
i did and have seen it many times since because it is really funny so there were lots of actors we seen on tv shows too this is a good and funny movie that i still love,positive
you just want her gone from your life that woman is your mother what does he do a fun movie it is and the cast is great a classic,positive
this has it all youll figure it out but you never know,positive
this movie has everything this is definitely a must see,positive
i dont think thats the case even though some parts might be taken that way if you dont look behind the obvious if you can be strong you really should see this film,positive
this was one of my favorite series when i was a kid,positive
as ive often said about this flick if you dont get it youre way lame,positive
she does a nice job and shes not bad to look at either what can i say,positive
unfortunately the movie ends up a big long and the director doesnt seem to know how to end it but most for of the running time this is very much worth seeing,positive
well i had fun watching the movie its not a great movie either just a rather well made horror movie in my opinion the acting was ok the scary moments were often predictable but not always nice its a good horror movie enough suspense,positive
this movie did not even come close to being boring predictable in some parts sure but never boring the movie was very enjoyable and fun in this film he does a great job he says maybe i should be the one to move out,positive
i just watched it last night and it was great the movie is great it has a lot of heart great family movie i love movies based on true stories events see it for yourself must see movie loved it,positive
but i think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much i have never had an experience like watching this movie but overall this is the best experience i have had in a movie theater in quite a long time,positive
i think that is why this film is so special if you have a chance please see this movie for yourself,positive
but theres so much more to this film it gets better every time i see it,positive
i do wish there were some way i could see it again,positive
i doubt it i doubt it i doubt it i doubt it i doubt it,positive
this movie is an example we never feel he is truly right but we can understand where he comes from there is plenty of action in the movie there is also some humor this director and writer team got it right complete success,positive
i loved this film when i was little although many people might not enjoy some of the songs most of them are well done and go along with the story,positive
the music is amazing the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for,positive
yes its that good perfectly written perfectly cast perfectly directed and perfectly acted in other words perfect,positive
remember just because its made for television doesnt mean it isnt great art,positive
the first also killing off others was bad bad boys but sorry guys i cant help it he is really and what do we get,positive
this show was absolutely great and i always look forward to watching it,positive
hell i was right should we ask more for a first movie,positive
they need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at,positive
this is a great example of a good dumb movie no it is not high art by any means but so what,positive
this movie ive seen many times the movie does not start on the same place as the book starts overall a great movie meant to be seen,positive
and what men want is her well you know for a movie of that era anyway,positive
this movie was well acted and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie,positive
i think this is the first real directors cut ive ever seen that wasnt the case it really felt like i was watching a whole new movie same movie but different feel but they just go so well together the editing is the real star of the film,positive
it also does a good job of making you question the good guys,positive
so what of this dvd when did this come out i love this dvd,positive
i would buy a copy if it were on dvd and it is too bad it isnt,positive
just as we all do at times go get it,positive
the end result seems to be a little of both how true,positive
soundtrack for the time was also great this is not really the sequel to the first and dont watch it if thats what you want,positive
the plot is predictable but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent for the time on the big screen that is on a tv it just looks average i remember this scene in the theater it made you feel like you were really up there,positive
what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie,positive
and then i was in the theater for close to four hours but it was worth it this film did that,positive
what did he do oh boy and guess what that short was on there and i loved it,positive
well almost any time reason not possible simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for and then a third this movie is a big hit,positive
this is definitely an excellent show but it was not instead of the classic mother daughter relationship it is a story of the best friend relationship about a mother and daughter the characters are perfectly cast and all do a superb job it is definitely the best tv show i have very come across,positive
in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch it,positive
just brilliant writing and good acting they were all believable and thats all they need to be,positive
a great film we look forward to seeing more films from mr,positive
hope you all now get the chance to enjoy this classic short comedy again,positive
of course thats just on the outside its all there just watch it,positive
to those who read this comment watch it also keep an open mind this one did just that,positive
most people especially young people may not understand this film a very fine film,positive
youve never seen anything like it and its all real because its a documentary amazing,positive
one thing i just thought of though not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone thats saying something,positive
i went to school with guys who came back live through it and then make comments,positive
now for the film its pretty good i wouldnt say its great though there are great scenes in it in fact id go as far to say that the acting scenes are better than the musical scenes not that the musical sequences are bad not at all they did lack something though i always have they are perfect for this film they just feel far away i believe he had the right idea but perhaps went too far in that direction i couldnt help thinking he was mr,positive
etc and killed wait the thing is everything here is perfect first acting and thats not the end of the list the story is really,positive
i hope that well soon see more of his work see it,positive
i must admit i didnt expect this to be as good as it was this was just a good all around story,positive
and why in the end because of the fact that i enjoyed everything its a little hard to find that it ends,positive
who doesnt know of these two its not good then there is the writing is fine i recommend this to fans of the characters,positive
ok here is how i do this i all in all less is more and this had it all almost perfect ending most definitely,positive
not that all performances are excellent though i highly recommend it,positive
now that i have seen it it was not what i was expecting at least not until the very end that was a nice effect a very interesting take on the genre indeed,positive
my father the hero has many funny moments like when hes at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something french,positive
i must say great great great and not just the acting some of the things they came up with for this movie was amazing,positive
why you might ask i would love to see more films with them together,positive
when this movie came out it was a must to see it,positive
it is however very enjoyable and gets you thinking oh crap overall the film is what i would call entertaining id say its worth a watch,positive
this film is the reason why horror can be a great genre,positive
sure it may not be a classic but its one full of classic lines,positive
you come out of it with a lot to think about i like that in a movie,positive
perfect beautiful funny simply wonderful i loved it its a great love story,positive
the whole audience was just one funny scene after another he was great anyway loved the film ill be looking forward to seeing this on dvd later this year i highly recommend this one,positive
anyway this will all make sense once you have seen this classic all i can say is enjoy,positive
this is a wonderful movie id buy it if i could find it,positive
but this time he finally does it right and that makes it so great ok true i didnt understand all of it the first time but that makes it only better,positive
i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh because yes it is funny well thats about it,positive
this is a fun fun movie that is basically the plot whats wrong with that especially this film thats all it is because thats what really makes it entertaining never again could movies like this get made know why its a shame it will never be the same again,positive
we would talk about nothing else at school the next day,positive
this is one fine movie i can watch it any time,positive
i like the film but like everything else in this world everyone has their opinion love it or hate it no matter what a movie does someone will always say why didnt they do it another way in other words you cant please everyone this film always kept me interested a lot of films use other ideas from other movies and sometimes change them around fun film,positive
i wish i could tell those actors just how much that series meant to me,positive
then we hear something that sounds like a party our star of the picture has his number and his friend his,positive
this film ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is,positive
its hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made,positive
i loved this movie his performance is nothing short of excellent is a bit sad but im sure youll like it anyway man on fire is one of the years best movies,positive
where to start i just love this story it simply did not look that interesting boy was i so wrong just like the book you cannot stop watching reading and when it does end until they must ive never read or heard of anything like it seriously no way that did not just happen did it i never do that how awful it is though the actors are just superb brilliant even everyone else in the cast were perfect actually anyone and everyone should see this movie and read the book there are only four other films i have given that same rating too this is one of those films,positive
very good acting and script not for people who do not like to think,positive
i love all characters and i can watch it again and again enjoy it,positive
i absolutely was into it and the music is so nice it is really amazing,positive
well if you take the film seriously like mr and this is cool this makes the film very very good you see this is either high art,positive
this film was hilarious i hope to see more from the writer director in the future,positive
sort of the movie starts and you have no idea where things are and then whats on screen is either interesting or funny and you just go with it how do we get from thing to thing is often beyond me very very funny at times its a interesting look at the nature of love and what is true love,positive
all at the same time one of the best films from that period ive seen in a long time,positive
still its nice to look at for what it is,positive
this is the reason i watched cover girl and if nothing else this dance is truly worth it this isnt to say that the film is bad it isnt but its just not quite a classic,positive
just because i felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that i had to watch several times to get he didnt over do his character who was crazy and just made it work and was extremely believable but the whole movie was just great the cast the sets just the whole picture was a great one what is right and what is wrong who knows,positive
the first time i saw this film i loved it it was different its a watch over and over movie,positive
i didnt know what to expect from it but nor did the young couple,positive
i wanted to love this movie despite all this i didnt love it i never knew it didnt believe it so there you have it,positive
one of my favorite movies of all times have seen it three times already great great movie,positive
that said everyone should watch this film however it may not be for everyone,positive
so whats the reason now i want more way too much drama everything that can go wrong does but for once theres a drama thats really real real people real problems i cant seem to get enough this could be one of the best shows of all time,positive
the list goes on you get the picture well to the actual plot of the film dont read the plot go see it because it is a good movie,positive
in fact there is simply no other war film like it mr mr,positive
okay i saw this movie as a child and really loved it i remember a few lines of certain songs such as you cant keep a good dog down,positive
following a family as they go through life and problems etc and believe me it works,positive
i knew you wouldnt let me down i knew it,positive
i do not think this is the point of the film at all but i dont think they go back to being exactly like they were before,positive
at this point we hear help s s s our point is just this,positive
it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much thats it,positive
the gore is rather too much at times but certainly this is a great movie,positive
the movie is based on a stage play and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play i actually really liked this movie its the acting in this one that makes it so great,positive
at first i didnt didnt like it that much although i did its amazing how many famous stars are there dont you think so,positive
its all so over the top and thats the beauty of it youll know it when you see it loved it,positive
everyone should totally see this movie it really is great well not really,positive
i guess shes the kind of actress who had better not act before camera but just be herself,positive
the movie does have problems still they turn in ok performances try seeing the directors cut,positive
this show would never be made today and that this a shame it does not seem right,positive
ok there are people who should not see this movie,positive
i love this movie i would like to see more movies like this and when you get to the final scene well what can i say,positive
thats a shame if you ever have a chance to see this well give it a try,positive
this time it seems they had what they needed and used them well,positive
i always loved this film the music story and the action the sets and the scenes are wonderful,positive
well worth a watch if you already like the genre you wont be disappointed unless you really dont like the genre,positive
etc etc you get the point i have to buy this one,positive
it was like a bad dream but i gave it a second chance then another and another etc heard in the middle and near the end of the film,positive
it was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people i would recommend everyone see this documentary see it if you get a chance,positive
i just have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time,positive
his opening scene is a classic not a must see but good for a fun hour or so,positive
so stay out you understand stay out red is used in every scene of course,positive
both my friend and i thought this movie was well done if you dont buy rent it for a good time,positive
each person makes this show worth watching lets move on,positive
the first half hour was really hilarious and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch,positive
i was still thinking about the story days after id seen the movie see it im sure youll love it as much as i did,positive
this is not a movie you watch for entertainment at least most people i know would not,positive
when i watched the eye i was kind of disappointed about this two guys who i had heard good words about them before so i decided to see one take only and i didnt disappointed again the only problem about this film is i get a bad dvd,positive
and after all wasnt movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway,positive
i did not know this when i first started watching the movie made ever so much more since the music they cut out should have been left in,positive
is that so the plot thats the story in the story what you see is true,positive
its a crime comedy thats often very funny there are some great actors playing these characters this is a highly entertaining flick i certainly recommend it,positive
you just have to love this masterpiece ill never forget it s,positive
terrible i know who i dont know if we ever were go see it now on the big screen,positive
ive watched it a few times ive been showing all my friends it is a film which will find its friends and i hope there are a lot of them out there oh and it has a great soundtrack,positive
so why didnt i give it ten stars a great job,positive
this is a great film i first saw this film when it came out,positive
what mr if it were not for mr no its not live action peter s the voice actors are wonderful david,positive
im not making this up is this a horror comedy what the hell am i watching see it,positive
well be seeing her a lot in the next coming years its better,positive
it was an excellent show and let die way before its time what a shame please,positive
straight up i love this film i love everything about it all he wants to do is have fun and he comes out with some great lines he then says good night and the scene ends it is a perfect scene he really lives to party and have fun if this is a film that you havent seen give it a chance it is a classic,positive
but when i found out i wasnt that surprised oh well a a liked the movie too i dont know if id ever watch it again but it wasnt too bad,positive
i found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable if you are a fan of these stars you will not be disappointed,positive
okay as you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films this is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious,positive
mr i certainly wasnt much of a fan at the time and didnt see too many episodes mr in other words mr while mr,positive
he begins to find out that she is not the same,positive
who should watch this film this film is great this film is cool or perhaps i never watched this film at all or maybe it really happened to me i dont know,positive
excellent plot within a plot within a plot you never quite know whos going to out do who recommend to all,positive
just as the way the life goes in day today atmosphere the movie has been taken especially background score its amazing,positive
the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast it wasnt what i was expecting at all and it wasnt just the cast that did it for me every time you were expecting something to happen it didnt happen the cinematography along with the set was absolutely beautiful as well i really cant say anything bad about this movie,positive
in a very long time i would love to find a way to show it to others,positive
a simple little family fun movie we especially like the songs in the movie mostly during the end credits we love his movies,positive
yes a true classic you should try and enjoy it too,positive
she is still very much in love a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy on the other hand it is hilarious it is that sense modern,positive
you may not like it but it is certainly something worth watching,positive
a simple comment what can i say this is a wonderful film that i can watch over and over it is real to life situation done perfectly,positive
i saw this movie with my family and it was great,positive
but the best part of the show is new york city,positive
overall i would have to say that i liked the movie some of the fight scenes are really good i mean really,positive
thats right the movie is better than the book dont get me wrong i love the book but the movie is just so much better some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book,positive
maybe not suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film due in part to the plot development non horror fans will want to avoid this,positive
nothing like this was seen on tv at that time and probably never will again then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention you would miss several jokes in the background dont pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry oh well everything cant be perfect he probably made a lot of money though,positive
he was hot those episodes were great overall i really miss this show,positive
i dont know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years,positive
has it she says that she will come back to him performances however there is one more thing that i must mention at the end,positive
full house is a great show she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor it really is a good show what do you think it will make you feel a lot better remember you must start watching full house and soon,positive
i thought this movie did a down right good job dont wait for it to be a classic watch it now and enjoy it,positive
this is a wonderful piece of cinema and i can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews,positive
the best french movie ive seen and french cinema is very good,positive
first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes because of this movie i do now but im not so sure thats a good thing everything here no one really needed to know that is definitely so not true and very very sad that wasnt too great oh well,positive
despite being made for tv this is first rate entertainment,positive
this one was easily the class of the group that says a lot,positive
if youre a western fan be sure to check it out if you have a chance,positive
however this movie is not for everyone others might see the movie as boring because its just so real that its almost like a documentary,positive
well the movie is more than good but not extremely good,positive
robert is a good man and i hope it does well,positive
this is an important film theres a lot to like here,positive
the plot is a bit hard to follow now we know he made this movie the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor a true classic,positive
no doubt it would be just as great as the other two,positive
back to the movie the real star is of course the general lee is all about,positive
i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment the acting is good the script is funny,positive
having just seen it again a few moments ago i would have to say that the film only got better over time,positive
this movie is very well done although the ending is given away too early in the film,positive
seeing it again years later it still works i actually had to turn a light on during one of them a creepy little tv movie worth seeing,positive
i thought it was very memorable as was the book the cast was brilliant another thing,positive
it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on t,positive
you cant run away from dark to the other people he is a hero who tries to save them all every big sci fi fan should see this picture,positive
why but i do know there has to be a better way,positive
its the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time,positive
having just seen this i find it hard to believe that it is not better known,positive
everything about this film is just perfect the film has a great cast as you can see from imdb but theres a very cool twist at the end,positive
when i was a child this was the movie i watched,positive
the movie is absolutely silly really no not really absolutely a love interest come on id watch it again,positive
this is a good movie dont like it dont watch it,positive
what a shame this movie was never released i like to be surprised give this film a chance,positive
i was right i think theyre all pretty good films,positive
otherwise as he said what am i doing shes not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit the question soon becomes though not what is the usual,positive
what more could i say s s s anyway there are a lot of things to like about the movie s,positive
i have to admit that i did not care too much for the ending,positive
great entertainment from start to the end the movie was made for me funny lines in the screenplay good music,positive
its truly a wonderful film very well done go out and see it and youll know exactly what i mean,positive
and so i had to see this the story is simple enough but it is the characters that make this film interesting then there was what happens with the female lead,positive
but it is good it have funny parts some of the songs are great others not very much but i like this show,positive
and guess what off course any male who is not as good as these guys are going to hate them and hate the show,positive
he has been running for too long this time it ends,positive
this not very well known picture is well written and acted a must see,positive
a lot of the time it didnt seem like a low budget film so that is a plus,positive
i have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy what can i say she looks especially amazing in this film as for the music it was excellent a must see for everyone,positive
i just wanted to say that everything else about it was so so,positive
this has to be the best movie of all time in my opinion this movie is quite sad and some people dont understand the ending the king played his role well since it is a hard role to play,positive
i love this movie i liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny,positive
the story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch,positive
there were other great scenes throughout the movie you just couldnt help but wonder if he was going to make it but towards the end you find out but when they play the third something is very wrong at that part i lost it you just have to overall this movie was excellent,positive
it really is a shame that their isnt a soundtrack that would have been great,positive
the first time i saw it i have to admit i had never seen anything like it its just great great great movie,positive
its humor is as funny and its message as strong,positive
how can a little girl have a voice so big she is truly amazing i believe you can truly make it,positive
this film is a must see for anyone writing a mother daughter relationship of this kind,positive
even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts,positive
i didnt know what to expect but it never came and so it happened,positive
all these makes it a moving and fun film to watch,positive
this film has not been seen by me in quite a few years i know that if anyone takes the time to view this film they will find it definitely worth seeing a second time its very memorable in more ways than one s,positive
it seems that every time i watch it i see something different,positive
the movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well the script is very well written all in all an excellent film,positive
ive never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released why is it not on dvd,positive
sure its certainly a strange premise but one thats never been done before the acting is pretty good no other reason,positive
i loved this movie just watch the film as i said i loved this movie,positive
anything and everything does happen there the show is also very funny,positive
this is not a story the less you know about this film as you watch it the better,positive
dont watch this if you have a weak heart you wouldnt be able to stand it,positive
back to my point the acting was top class as one would expect at least i know now,positive
unfortunately the film does not stand up to the cinematography,positive
the two may never see each other again but it isnt the cinematography nor the acting of one or two people that makes this film a success,positive
or is it still used that way today as i write this i am thinking how much earlier this film seems to me to have been set,positive
not having seen it for a while we decided to take another look at this comedy mr,positive
excellent piece of work a must see there is a lot to enjoy here,positive
the film has a different feel to it you dont give love away to anyone but you keep it for your true love,positive
we were there keep up the good work another of that genre is city of god also dont laugh,positive
as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him,positive
how do they do it you might ask well they dont do it very well thats for sure,positive
i admit that i almost gave up on watching tv shows why house crap with just a main title,positive
saw this movie and totally loved it the characters are great,positive
i wont give it away but the end is really great,positive
great movie i thought it would never be as good as it was great special effects great story big laughs it didnt take itself seriously which is why i think it worked so well,positive
but i didnt i expect they go back and their world is if you have an open mind however i highly recommend this movie,positive
this is my favorite movie ever but this is my favorite movie he has done so far i just cant say enough good things about it,positive
the movie is low budget at times but fun to watch its a great dark comedy and funny id really like to see a sequel to this movie one day too i doubt it will happen though,positive
there is no one that can play this part so well and whats more brilliant script brilliant idea perfect cast great film,positive
and i watch it from time to time still other than that its a really fun feel good movie and i do recommend it i wish it would come out on dvd,positive
when i watched it a second time though it made a lot more sense the soundtrack is great as well,positive
lost probably the best t after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting how ever you want to put it but it does every thing happens for a reason and that is truly shown in the series you see a major twist that can or will change everything too me and many others its this series lost once you start watching you wont get enough lost is completely unique and original you wont see anything like it would they ever make a series like lost something so interesting and something you will always remember every episode leads to something new and it just doesnt stop getting better and better you get more interested as it goes along you learn things that are on the island that you wouldnt even think off so if you dont watch lost read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind start watching you have not seen nothing until you watch lost,positive
this movie has some of the best dialogue ever written i love this movie,positive
i didnt want to because it was such an old film how could that be good i finally did watch with that friend and my father my friend and i loved the film the songs are great the actors were cool and we were crazy about it its a nice good and sometimes funny film if you dont try you cant say its bad try the first part of the film you can always stop watching if you dont like it i really recommend it its great,positive
however we have what we have war is here too i do not know what to say it makes you think,positive
i loved this film the only film apart from the die hard series that i watched this often in short do not for a minute think that you own the t,positive
youll probably either love it or hate it too the music through the movie was beautiful,positive
not many people like this movie but i love classic love movies theyre so much better than movies now,positive
it is a shame it did not get a major release,positive
does it matter whether or not hes in this film,positive
of course the main stars in this one are great but the supporting actors are also superb as the other comments i also say buy this one,positive
well some times love this is a show you have to watch,positive
this is a movie that has a lot of things that only japanese people can understand,positive
and have watched it on video an average of once a year since,positive
but the characters themselves why would she even want to be in the same town as him to say nothing of the same room give us a break,positive
if only i had seen this film as a kid,positive
i see that it has been released this year with all original songs i would love to have either version,positive
yes its a good flick but he got what was coming to him,positive
everyone plays their part pretty well in this little nice movie,positive
you really feel for this guy i never heard of the actors before but i liked all three very much,positive
great movie ok well i got them at the same time the quality on the dvd is way better i couldnt believe it,positive
you wish that they will find each other love whether it comes too early or it comes too late to take the one and not the other person,positive
i enjoyed this movie okay it just could have been so much better i was expecting more action than what i got which was more of a comedy than anything else,positive
its not bad but its really not very good i have to say i so did not care by that point other than that just dont see it,positive
i went to this film having no idea what to expect the original plot is very easy to follow,positive
an excellent family movie gives a lot to think on theres absolutely nothing wrong in this film everything is just perfect the script is great its so real this picture is a real cant miss,positive
this is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well known but is well liked by the people who have seen it,positive
although some parts were a little dramatic guess what i think it was an amazing movie,positive
i dont recommend that to anyone i still cant believe i didnt see the ending coming,positive
i always look forward to this movie when its on tv have to get the dvd i guess my favorite character must be mr would make for the perfect sequel if they had not sure if i want to,positive
i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago,positive
lots of great fight scenes action and characters to make the movie memorable if your a die hard fan of the game you will love this movie i thought it was a really really good movie and yes its on my list of movies to get all in all its the best movie ive seen yet based on a video game,positive
it is simply an entertaining little movie its not supposed to change the world i thought all the actors did a great job with their characters,positive
i recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like you are watching a real family thats how much feeling this movie has it made me feel real sorry for him like it was real,positive
you may think that this is an average comedy show about hard life with a family,positive
it is seems as if it is a great song i would love to get a copy of it it just seemed to be believable,positive
the acting throughout is excellent no question there was not quite enough action for me i must say no real suspense as such just plenty of first class character development very well done though,positive
there couldnt have been a better actor for the job,positive
the acting is not as bad as one might expect either,positive
dont read if you havent seen this series or you can whatever the best of the best,positive
i absolutely loved this film as if she knows shes going with god perhaps i am thinking way to much into it i really liked the music that was used in the background music can sometimes make or break a film,positive
i liked it because it ends the way things really do,positive
i had always wanted to watch it but never got around to it when it was in the cinema,positive
its a show that could of gone as far as friends went amazing show with all the best actors,positive
the girls then are made to realize how much they need each other,positive
and i loved it the characters are really great especially for its time now the music this is my favorite part of the game,positive
wouldnt it be nice to have all your friends parents be young again,positive
i just wanted to say that when i was young my favorite t i loved the characters and the plot of the show i thought that it was an excellent show and still do to this day i love the way the characters played off one another i would always stay up late to watch my favorite show with my mother who also was a big fan which i thought was a cool song for the show,positive
this is a movie youll either love or hate i loved it you wont find it in this movie i know people like these ive seen people who know what really is important in life any of these people could have been people i knew if you dont like a movie that shows the better side of human nature youll hate it,positive
this movie is a fantastic movie i know mr that being the case why isnt this one anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it mr,positive
what an actor id like to see more of this actors work dont cut,positive
every home should have a copy dont take my word for it see it yourself,positive
watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actors sounds like a real turn off right,positive
its even better than i expected go to see it,positive
this movie though i loved it was great the plot was well done and it was a fun movie both had there strong points i mean really good,positive
now i want to know where to find the movie soundtrack there are songs in this soundtrack i have been trying to get for years may i comment on the acting for a second i can only dream,positive
its not meant to be a deep movie its something worth watching,positive
thats not at all what i mean its truly saying something,positive
its too bad a a look so good youll enjoy this,positive
great acting great sets great music beautiful storyline if only there were a lot more movies made like this one the sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there,positive
another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great but thats only my opinion others may like these elements,positive
i liked this movie a lot other than that it was great,positive
it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance,positive
this movie is great then we see the great video for leave me alone and straight into the main feature the plot isnt really the important part,positive
this movie is creepy and is very well done the couple is not doing well hes trying to give her more direction its a role that men sometimes take on,positive
people dont know what its about isnt that the best reason to see a movie,positive
why dont you write about movies you like like me definitely watch this movie,positive
i enjoyed this film which i thought was well written and acted good fun,positive
in the end you are happy you saw it i was at least maybe even this year stay during the credits there are some pretty funny moments,positive
i did not know it was based on fact until the end,positive
ive seen this one plenty of times over the years and will probably see it several more just dont think too much and youll love it enjoy,positive
the acting by all of these actors is very good the movie is filmed very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end,positive
no one should and yet its so funny so horrible and so wrong and more power to him,positive
but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie,positive
its another to do it for a whole tv movie,positive
its a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen,positive
well now this was certainly a surprise episode or does it it doesnt appear that he and mr,positive
we will never know if this could have been a great series,positive
despite all of this no one goes to the police,positive
i cant find anyone that lives near me that knows what i am talking about i remember so much about it,positive
the others are not bad either but then i thought s,positive
is it better to live in a box or to not live at all see it for yourself great movie,positive
this movie doesnt give all that it appears to be another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction,positive
the action is all completely realistic the acting is excellent if you like this genre i cannot recommend this movie highly enough,positive
they were all fantastic it starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days,positive
its such a shame that this really is the end i could watch it all over again,positive
one that i remember was in the opening where the episodes title was different from the one shown on the screen,positive
i thought it was ok decent no doubt but with these guys involved it should have been better too short in the end to really matter if it had time to get going more it would have been excellent for sure,positive
i dont like it when people say that i dont understand,positive
a complete tale the same story told in two different ways,positive
this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen the acting and plot are amazing i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama,positive
this movie is the most moving and funny movie ive seen in a very long time,positive
but they never did quite make them like this a must see,positive
its not really a drama its not really a thriller and its not really a comedy instead its more a movie with its own style that does things its own way but just like the movie its main character the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts,positive
i loved this film the only part i didnt enjoy was in the special features,positive
but this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it,positive
now that is only in the first few minutes ridiculous in a good way no make that a great way at the time she wasnt really known for much,positive
this is a movie i could watch over and over again i highly recommend it,positive
the film is worth watching again even for her performance alone,positive
i read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more i think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic i liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out the special effects were very good i would love to see more horror movies like this one other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs the dvd has some interesting special features,positive
and what is more youll probably enjoy it my son,positive
this movie is not great but it is a good and enjoyable one,positive
but he does and i love it and i love him,positive
i love horror movies and i really liked this one there were so many surprise scenes whats the english word i think the most scary scene was the make up is also very good,positive
this film starts as it ends and ends as it starts,positive
this movie sets out to do something very particular it also sets out not to do certain things never mind what the actors would do what would you do in their situation,positive
one of the best child performances ever put simply a perfect film,positive
it was really funny in one moment probably why i liked it and then just as serious in the next,positive
after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies,positive
this movie is amazing both leads are fantastic as well as the entire cast check it out,positive
still crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time you care about the people in still crazy,positive
what can we say not at all fun to watch i own the video and will watch it again and again,positive
i thought the performances were wonderful there are also a number of wonderful battle scenes,positive
makes you stop and think and laugh the movie is really funny could it be that the stupid are already taking over,positive
the acting directing and script is all perfect it sure is in my book,positive
i never heard of this film before i was right but i was also wrong and look at her eyes shes also a true talent as seen on many other movies,positive
boy am i happy that it is because its a beyond cool movie go see it if you already havent,positive
i must admit this is one of my favorite horror films of all time what can be better,positive
the story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes if you have the chance watch this on theater its a totally different experience but as scary as this movie,positive
with a cast like this i knew the acting would be amazing well never know because they didnt try at least not in the way i expected,positive
that way you get into the storyline more and night time viewing works well with this movie i felt like i would have loved to have been there in the movie with the cast,positive
its a real shame because this is a really great film,positive
i truly enjoyed this film the only part of this flick i would change was the ending,positive
and thats not the best part of the game not by far,positive
a lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out,positive
there i think maybe the director could have done better,positive
the scenes with them seemed out of place i found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch,positive
i thought it had such a cool and highly original storyline thinking back im still surprised that it was shown during the day on t,positive
the music is probably what makes this episode work so well,positive
all in all this is brilliant film and one that everyone should make the effort to see at least once,positive
and by the way the sex is hot watch out for this one,positive
i really enjoyed this movie she will never know how much that means to me you are the greatest,positive
i remember watching this film thinking was so interesting i really wanted to know what happens next kid b says to kid a lets not go to class today,positive
it was one of the best films that i have seen this year everyone should go see this film,positive
perhaps more than many films this one is not for everyone,positive
i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this,positive
i did like this movie that was great this story has been done so many times before and there was just not much new here again,positive
i loved this movie this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love i highly recommend it to everyone,positive
it seems very very real this movie is not about how to make a realistic film it is about how such a film would look like if it was real and it certainly would look like this if it would be filmed anyway is this true it all leads to the same and no one is surprised why not they do things but for nothing,positive
s now more than ever s s can they move to overall a good message film about hard times right here in america,positive
apparently theres much more to them but not the way they think i realize this was probably what mr,positive
ok its about a dog show thats really all there is to it but that makes it funny enough,positive
i had never saw the original and so when i watched this i thought it was unique,positive
i finally got my wish to see this one in a cinema,positive
the acting dialogue is very very real as close to reality as you can get for hollywood acting you cannot go your whole life without watching this film,positive
i can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind the lines just keep on coming in the movie,positive
since had a musical background he was able to do his own songs and it really works,positive
i love this film the songs and story lines are great fun is it that mr,positive
by the way there are two weird scenes in the film,positive
so definitely worth watching or maybe even a must see for all you horror and gore fans,positive
this is a great horror movie great plot this is a must see for any horror fan,positive
this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future,positive
again only for the true fans theres no way around that if youre not used to her style then you wouldnt get why this is funny however it is and i hope you think so too,positive
i will comment on the quality of them though watch if youre a fan its a pretty good one this year id recommend this show,positive
ive seen this film often and i love all of them and it,positive
the only bad thing about this movie is that its very difficult to get a copy of it it really is that good,positive
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen it is worth it to remember to feel it again,positive
this is the best movie ive come across in a long while,positive
this is a very good film this film has very interesting and strong characters,positive
we can do anything youll either hate it or love it,positive
take it for what it is leave it out of the theater,positive
his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far about that b there should be more movies like this,positive
the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining,positive
the very strong and well acted love scenes of course i recommend it,positive
this is a great short they dont in fact everyone he knows seem pretty crazy dont talk like that im sure youll be fine before i go yes can i just have,positive
i mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason we learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away it is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone and whether or not one person can change your life it is not only about our modern life but about where life could and should be in our modern time,positive
all i can say is first movie this season that got my attention but thats what makes it more realistic and thats what makes it better,positive
this has to be one of the best if not the best film i have seen for a very very long time it is a must watch for anyone rent this film buy this film just go out and watch this film you will not be disappointed,positive
this movie is very great but for the real horror thriller fan this is a must watch,positive
but overall the main star is the soundtrack a classic in the real sense of the word,positive
most horror movies are in fact horrible movies less is more this movie almost has the feel of a masterpiece theater production this is how a really great horror film should be,positive
each does there part in making this movie wonderful etc this is a story about dance that actually has a story and a good one at that truly a well written film,positive
i watch it as often as i could and i still havent enough good humor,positive
a movie you can watch with your entire family around you a movie you will hate watching alone the story is simple but the music is good cinematography is excellent direction is best everything about the movie has a class of its own,positive
and it is almost every time hes present in this as a matter of fact my personal favorite episode is in the last season i recommend this to any fan of those who made it,positive
so do not expect this way to be realistic and true it could not be,positive
not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the over the top acting you often saw in other films of the day it got annoying from time to time,positive
plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too,positive
now he must cover up the murder little does she know shes got another one on her hands,positive
the series worked just fine in the present day it was not without its problems but those problems had nothing to do with the time period,positive
watching this i get the feeling were not getting the whole story but thats ok i wanted to see even more of it,positive
little did they know what would happen next you will enjoy this film,positive
oh i love love love it i could watch this movie every day,positive
this is a video game and not an actual movie at least i dont the story is obviously based on the story told in the movie this is truly the best feature of the game if you loved the movie you may enjoy the game,positive
it has everything that would make a great picture but thats about it a lot more,positive
why this movie is not yet on dvd or video is a mystery to me,positive
i once saw a documentary about the man but thats the only time i once saw or heard anything about him no one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject,positive
it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie is the film worth it after all theyre young people who have all their lives to live,positive
it seems put on it is definitely the version i will come back to from now on i also love the new scene at the end,positive
what to do what to do what a find what a day,positive
you will want to watch this film time and again,positive
and they could act it was all shown on this show,positive
can mr who are his true friends sure its not a classic like his earlier films but its still enjoyable,positive
it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously thats the reason why he is most interesting director on earth whether you like it or not,positive
then youll see one thats realistic but it might be too dull to keep you interested of course if youve got a girl next to you and youre a guy like me it probably doesnt matter all that much whether the movies any good youve got other things on your mind for the rest of us i say see a guy thing its a lot of fun plot is going to make everyone happy,positive
i also enjoyed that i recommend taking the time to watch this movie i will watch it again i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played,positive
it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience it is however a beautiful movie she does her best i recommend this movie highly,positive
this is a really fun movie i have never been a great fan of her but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies if you want good laughs and a fun time make sure to watch this movie,positive
all in all the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didnt expect much but at the end i actually enjoyed this film,positive
where does one start mr i will not go into the story as it is better seen than read mr,positive
other than that it was great it wouldnt be real otherwise,positive
this movie is my all time favorite movie it has funny moments sad moments and happy moments who could ask for anything more this movie is great,positive
many years ago i saw this movie on television maybe and loved it it did you just know that a love story will play out between them i it has a great story great acting and a great script,positive
i love this movie they seemed perfect for each other i was very wrong though this movie was fantastic well i just dont think a man could get over his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had ever been with his entire life go rent it today,positive
first of all i think this movie was very funny and from my point of view i would recommend it to everyone this is more then that you have to love them all and all others,positive
b i dont see the joke he says b b but also shows,positive
the more i see it the more i like it this guy knows about action and its particularly good in this movie still good to see him,positive
its quality almost is of tv movie but of the good ones,positive
for that reason alone its pretty interesting if not a little hollywood dont believe me not too deep but but enjoy the movie,positive
i am so happy that i did so thats what this movie was about in fact so too did mr,positive
the acting is all around quite perfect and it sounds just absolutely fantastic,positive
i am absolutely crazy about the show i think the entire cast is excellent its one of my favorite show ever that is really sad i hope they will bring it back,positive
if you have a chance to see this movie i recommend that you do,positive
this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just cant hate it and i really love the soundtrack,positive
i saw this movie years ago if this comes out on video i will definitely buy it,positive
actually that video camera effect is just that its an effect a rather good one watching this film you can understand how real movies are made as this is sort of like a film within a film,positive
i happen to like him a lot not everyone will like it,positive
i hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel,positive
but im not here to talk about them this movie is not what you would expect see it,positive
i mean i liked it all until the end where it is funny except,positive
this film is brilliant without a doubt and it is good a great film,positive
i have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this music that can make one dance perfect all said this movie was and will be perfect for many years to come,positive
i just saw this movie for the first time last night what a movie this is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see because its just so cool and so interesting,positive
the more things change the more they stay the same both are perfect i love this film,positive
and many of them still do at least on some level,positive
im here to help not reading the box before watching the dvd movie was the better way to go here by the end of the movie i finally put it all together well it was obvious by then the rest of the cast were very good as well whats the message i didnt,positive
there are moments when you dont want those deep drama series there are moments when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of action and cool characters but the thing is thats the point and thats why i like it it isnt like any other series the first season wasnt very good the story was a little lame and you didnt get to know the characters very much and it was here i started to love it,positive
not to say this movie is not without its problems so maybe this isnt a perfect movie there are some people that need movies like this and well take whatever we can get,positive
nothing is left to chance a great film by a great director,positive
the last five minutes of the film were perfect which was the point,positive
or more particularly does not want to get it one has to wonder what people think they are looking at,positive
at the time i had no idea who any of the actors were now i see that many of them have become well known over the years,positive
so many of them seem new all over again they just dont make stuff like this these days,positive
you can only enjoy this film and watch it again,positive
after i first saw it i thought it was wonderful there are some other moments in the movie as well,positive
when i read other comment i decided to watch this movie finally i recommend to watch this movie,positive
loved the movie just loved it the acting was great not sure where the story was with mr,positive
by far it was my favorite there was a good story in each episode,positive
for a while i left this film alone and didnt watch it for a while,positive
i truly recommend this film if you like to laugh,positive
but if you like it you really like it check it out,positive
all right but would they go for a tv series mr b a,positive
it has been one of my favorite for those of you who have not seen it please see it i cant wait to see it again and highly recommend it hope you all like it as well,positive
the call for a dvd box set is well based bring on the dvd box set,positive
i dont think ill ever forget it more people need to see this film,positive
i loved every minute of it however i have to say that the story is not very believable,positive
i must admit this is one of the best love movies maybe the best of all i have ever watched and of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real,positive
this movie felt so real the story is great this is a must see film for everyone,positive
s the t i liked the show a lot and most people i know like it as well,positive
for a first time director whose background i believe is in writing he has a great eye i would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director t,positive
im definitely going to follow it the stories told by this series are also interesting anyway i think this is one good tv shows,positive
mr his parents were english dont believe them he doesnt try too hard why should he,positive
i just want to say that this movie was excellent i loved it from the beginning until the end the acting was great the director did an amazing job and i would like to see it again rent it rent it rent it,positive
ten out of ten stars its hard to believe this was a made for television movie,positive
what a good movie why they have a different point of view about rock about love and about life like anyone of us and finally thinking of your own future,positive
yes i watch this show well at least thats what i tell my friends,positive
its horrible youll definitely see yourself in this film and it wont be pretty change it,positive
theres no other word for it wrong alone it can be hilarious,positive
you really should stop reading these comments and watch the film now she is that good,positive
with those words mr but also the story its interesting and entertaining at moments it could turn too weird but when you got inside it its hard to get out of it,positive
now everyone wants to be famous overall this film is good,positive
it was made at a time where the story was more important that the special effects though the effect are fairly good for its time i dont want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give the rest of the movie away,positive
its about the girls are also very good looking and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable,positive
first off we all love the hero well its not pretty and for the most part hilarious maybe not,positive
the acting is so well done and the story so well done that this film is still very entertaining today this fact gets lost in film history this film is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved making it,positive
i havent seen every episode but i still enjoyed it there are many episodes that i enjoyed if you want to know why youll have to have seen it for yourself,positive
its really a simple story but also one that they need to hear at this age,positive
this is a great ending to the show however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic was a great way to show a new beginning,positive
i will buy this movie and watch it again this is a family film and i recommend it highly,positive
i really really enjoyed watching this movie but it is simply more than this even they were not for real we need our stars,positive
what a shame i guess im just happy that movies like seeing,positive
if you happen to come across this film check it out,positive
this is one of my three all time favorite movies,positive
not where the last film left off its that special,positive
does anyone happen to know where this film was shot,positive
nothing wrong with this however watch this movie and enjoy,positive
the plot is about as simple as it gets a,positive
the editing i think is wonderful really fast and often funny but i dont care because the real stars are the musical scenes,positive
anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you dont have to read the book to understand the movie,positive
i love this movie its classic anyone out there who wants to see some funny classic entertainment then watch whos that girl her acting is superb,positive
but you have to understand its not a horror movie,positive
it was shot to look cheap or was it just cheap does that take away from the experience thats what makes it so great rent it buy it always,positive
this is one of the best tv movies i have ever seen the title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on all tv movies are like that the story is fantastic it may seem ridiculous but it is based on an incredibly true story,positive
he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do and that is what makes watching him so fun they are great together you will love this film,positive
and came across this film what a fun and interesting one to watch i dont know why they dont show it more often what does that say about us are not into film,positive
never mind though i wanted more story and character development shes a nice lady who we can really feel for but even then theres just not enough material to present it as such its a nice watch but not a classic,positive
maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously,positive
but despite this its still a good film and kept my interest however the rent is due and theres no money so the lady is forced to look for work all in all a very good film worth seeing but certainly not great,positive
finally the film was really beautiful to look at it and the music was good too the other actors were good also great i hope it comes out on dvd soon hope to see them both in more soon,positive
overall i must say i dont to much to say about this film not that it was bad its just a film you either like or dont like i would however recommend this to any and everyone even if you dont like these type of films its still an enjoyable film,positive
not a great movie mind you but a truly fun watch,positive
is that a good thing in short i thought it would be a comedy and he is an actor we felt that but then did he really care the last one he had very well done,positive
i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic i can not believe this one dont believe me well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie but i can not know for sure lets see,positive
i liked the way it was told as a documentary i didnt feel this had any of that very well done indeed,positive
i do not have watched the second yet but in this third one the story is full of action fans of sci fi movies will not be disappointed,positive
more so than any show that old that is the one show that i wish i could see again john,positive
i loved this film the ending was great as well,positive
movie in history i t then something wonderful happened b well there were none,positive
etc i wish i could buy the whole series on dvd,positive
it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning,positive
maybe it wasnt that good as a whole but the second episode which was the first one i say was so memorable i still remember it today,positive
although the movie was great all in all its worth the money,positive
even in the credits its based on the book its not the book,positive
you wont be able to stop watching if you start,positive
not too many people give this movie a chance it does work and he does it well like i said give it a chance,positive
i have watched this movie at least ten times and loved,positive
he says i had to get high to do what director wanted,positive
you can guess the rest everything looks so perfect and dream like a one of a kind film dont miss it,positive
people arent as stupid as some of you make out not everything is perfect however,positive
its very funny from beginning to end its that great and in my opinion its perfect,positive
watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series i highly recommend it,positive
it has comedy drama the soundtrack is great it is an all around good film,positive
the ending makes no sense so what works the gore,positive
everyone i knew saw it everyone i knew loved it,positive
this is a film this is a wonderful film a beautiful piece of work excellent a romantic fine acting and directing watching this film made me remember my first love,positive
i dont understand why everyone is so hard on this film something entertaining,positive
this movie was the second movie i saw on the cinema as a child great scary stuff nice,positive
if you dont expect too much this is an enjoyable movie,positive
in reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it you watch the movie excellent a,positive
what were they thinking the film is entertaining and the fighting is excellent,positive
thats the deal where the hell did you come from im your mother remember me,positive
ever sense i was a kid i have loved this movie,positive
dont get me wrong this is a piece of crap not that the first one was anything great,positive
but yet another reason why this movie is so perfect,positive
this is one of the best effort you will see in any film here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique but please dont expect anything more apart from films in this dvd,positive
i mean that in the best way possible i had a great time with this movie,positive
would any true fan want it any other way of course not i mean right now too,positive
i think i truly love this film this may have been the way they were shot i dont know,positive
not too many people seem to know about this movie which is too bad because i think its pretty good sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline its just a light easy going happy comedy and i recommend it,positive
i loved this movie at any rate this was a great film now thats entertainment,positive
you dont have to think about if it could really happen or if the acting is truly believable its just fun and thats all you can really ask for in this type of movie,positive
i love films that make you think they are about something but then you realize they are about something completely different,positive
this series is not reality television i hate reality television,positive
theres also a lot of comedy in this film and the first third of the movie could easily be the set up for a straight comedy film,positive
when you are watching the film you can feel what mr,positive
i will watch it for years to come all three great hours of it,positive
i do love b horror films i watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or b movies and even she was pretty into it totally fantastic,positive
i really enjoyed them the twist in the middle i felt was especially good,positive
and boy didnt they had have it coming he says,positive
the plot is very original and entertaining for the time,positive
what made this movie so good for me theres no forced romance,positive
but check this movie out it has a heart they all look so young,positive
anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review,positive
my god that thing my friends is beauty are they right,positive
all in all it was a good time at the movies for those who havent seen it be sure to watch it with an open mind and not take it too seriously take it as that,positive
oh man also i always want to make it a special day when i watch it,positive
this is a film that i love above all others well very different and so it is,positive
i was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater,positive
if you ever get a chance to see this short i highly recommend taking it,positive
the film itself isnt really a masterpiece but it is really worth watching,positive
they dont have time for silly things such as love you have but to look to see it for yourself,positive
watch a series or two of the show first before you watch this youll not be disappointed,positive
for those who enjoy this type of movie it is a classic masterpiece,positive
at times he even seems to be a man of the political left it is a good film but one that could have been a better one,positive
what an entertaining movie everything works out fine lets just make up she says that will give you something to work on it was a good idea,positive
they should have made a second season and so on god and leave all the boring stuff this show was a great idea but still hes so funny by all the things that he does hes always funny and finally jack the rock of the show oh hes the man hes like doing the same stupid things that the boys are doing the thing is this show had everything to become something really big it had everything man but of course,positive
i gave it a chance not expecting much ill leave it there,positive
moving right along and others its such a nice movie my rating a plus,positive
but im not sure what you would cut out no no so what if he wasnt an actor youll feel good after seeing this movie,positive
something is wrong with that picture it is a movie based on a comic book hero some great acting from some very good actors some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times,positive
it gets kind of silly at times but overall i recommend it,positive
this is certainly a movie that we will watch several times,positive
if you havent seen it yet then rent it out i am going to buy it when its released because i loved it i thought the plot was well written there was comedy and romance which are the type of films i love,positive
are the other films that i have had to watch this way,positive
this is one movie that will take time to get out of your head once you have seen it,positive
this is a pretty well known one so i wont get too deep into it the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci fi and monster movies,positive
but this tries very hard so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating because it tries it tries very hard the acting isnt the best here i dont know but i just loved the special effects in this film overall this isnt the best action film ever made but its not half bad either,positive
i loved this show it never has please let me know if there is a way we can have this series on dvd,positive
but the music is great once it comes in i love this movie often too often love it,positive
the movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world it should go pretty well the cast was great,positive
but it is basically the same as the first movie but the ending theme song was a plus i totally recommend it,positive
i i perfect not memorable but good to go back and watch years later,positive
she was saying something like dont let her get me or something like that,positive
i watched it when i was little and still do to this day,positive
well all is not well but it did have what most of those lack their love story wasnt forced on us like so many,positive
id love to see what they would dream up next,positive
this is an excellent stand up dvd i highly recommend this one its almost not worth watching however this really is a funny funny stand up show that everyone should see i was dead at the time,positive
almost feels like a documentary at times i can understand how others dont like it,positive
this is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldnt like it on the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff you need to run out and buy head now if you havent already but what is head about it seemed like a good idea back then and i still think its a good idea s s,positive
i kept thinking that i liked a lot of the people and wonder if i will see them again a sequel would be cool there is something for everyone,positive
i loved her in this and didnt she look fantastic the richard character was completely creepy,positive
so simple yet so powerful when hes good hes real good worth watching definitely,positive
i would recommend this movie as a good late night viewing its better than a lot of this genre the plot is excellent the acting isnt brilliant but its not bad,positive
anyway this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points but its good crap,positive
we loved the movie i am a mother to two little men but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please dont be over we both wish actors would not change family should all see this move buy it for friends really hope to see more,positive
and if you can see this movie with your best friend or your mother,positive
it would have been much better if he had had to clear his name,positive
but this was one of them perhaps that was the point reality is brought up,positive
they took him in so what no good movie well done,positive
not only does this movie have a great title but quite simply is the greatest drama i have ever watched,positive
but then it doesnt try to be anything it is not all in all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs well worth seeing,positive
there isnt as much action but the acting is just as good,positive
if you been there and done that you will absolutely love this film,positive
they seem to be typical a lot of people hate high school so what,positive
the three main characters are amazing possibly this was his best performance ever,positive
i loved the story what great music on the soundtrack what a nice this and what a nice that but most of all i will say two words to recommend this film why yes he did and you see thats what was perfect about this film beautiful film,positive
this movie is an excellent film let alone for a kids movie parents id say watch it first,positive
i first heard of this film from a friend she loved it and always watched it i was so wrong,positive
i loved this movie the first time i saw it the script is brilliant and the directing is almost as good,positive
and i dont mind at all all in all its entertaining would i rent it again no would i watch this tv show,positive
there are some scenes where you can understand that just a little the editing in this movie is great,positive
this movie is still great i think it is quite original i definitely recommend this film,positive
i know them they are our sad history and they are our present,positive
this is a well done piece of cinema this movie does that the film is full of drama and action and so is entertaining on that level as well,positive
no matter how cheesy it can be its still a great show and i would definitely recommend it to anyone,positive
if you dont like violence this is the movie to watch s,positive
what else is there to say there is of course great comedy among the other characters a,positive
i am not emotional but this film makes you feel the human being,positive
with that said this one was very interesting to me,positive
this is the only film made by this director how come he didnt make lots of films after this rather good one,positive
if you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see,positive
all i can say about this film is dont watch it alone,positive
it was absolutely brilliant they loved it too the songs are brilliant i still remember them all if you find the film buy it youll love it,positive
i didnt think so by turns were among the best in the film,positive
ok i love it this is when life was good and simple it could have gone much later than it did but anyway,positive
i didnt get it back then they made fun of themselves society everything great film,positive
if you dont take it all too seriously the movie is great fun to watch,positive
its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind theres not much to say about this piece of art but if youve not seen it watch it and enjoy,positive
sure there are better movies but i dont have that problem with this movie and that is so true because i want to take every movie seriously yet many oh so many let me down what a funny screenplay its either gone for good or here to stay,positive
this is on my see it every chance i get list,positive
its a true classic every terrible line of dialogue is totally amazing you wont believe your eyes its all i can say please please watch this movie,positive
all of them did very well in their roles an they worked great together,positive
big ones its really cool and that is good enough for me,positive
if you dont want to do those this film will make you want to do so,positive
but at the end of the episode you want to watch more and more and more its only the first of the lot and its excellent,positive
not so so what of the movie let me try again again thats not a bad thing the film was just so much rich entertainment until the final title really thats the worst i can say theres just so much in this movie for everyone,positive
the music is perfect and the acting is amazing i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period,positive
if you like movies that will make you think this is absolutely one of the good ones they have always made high quality movies enjoy this film i did,positive
i rate it one of the best ever i love all the cast they are so funny,positive
i really liked this movie the dialogue is good so anyway i liked it,positive
this is a really well made movie she works as and when she can but cannot make ends meet the acting is first rate,positive
well worth watching again if only it could be found fantastic,positive
yes is mostly comedy but there are some sad moments,positive
even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again i dont mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scene enjoy,positive
i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever,positive
so with all that said how is the movie i dont think thats true,positive
this flick is definitely of the first type its that good,positive
a film to buy if you dont own already and one to see if you have not,positive
too bad my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film just his face a great ending lots of wonderful characters,positive
i the music in this film is the best ive heard in any other film this films is a must see,positive
it doesnt work that way the acting is all decent s,positive
not only that but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time what makes the movie so great,positive
only a couple of days later it was shown on television the first reason is that this movie has an actual story i guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way,positive
she falls in love if only for perhaps a moment with life and love itself you just have to keep your heart open to see it,positive
is still with us again this is a great film which is something that one does not see very often today if at all,positive
from there things just go crazy plus the characters are hilarious mr when things go wrong in short no matter what age you are you will love this movie,positive
ive found that one a very good one and i thought this would not be as good,positive
before i start my review let me first say this this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while overall this is what kept me so interested in the movie and i really liked that part cinematography yes the cinematography,positive
she is not the only real person in the script this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr,positive
well ill be looking to buy a copy now liked the movie,positive
its simply just a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends for some laughs,positive
amazing performances the acting and directing are very powerful strong story often short films try to do too little or too much with the time or they are trying to tell a predictable story you wonder what will happen next while at the same time feeling you saw something happen nice score too,positive
i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do,positive
did it all make sense no one is happy in the film even if they believe that they are laugh all in all i really love this film i feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience it is a shame that the soundtrack was never released,positive
so it isnt just me this movie is a must see you will never forget it just like my sister and me,positive
i cant even think of my favorite part of the movie because they are all pretty good,positive
i will say it starts out a little slow but each tale get better and better so you can see there are big name stars just not the really big ones,positive
watch this show with a open mind its worth it,positive
but whos that girl is not a deep film the cast is always entertaining as usual,positive
with someone else very funny stuff with the right ending great film,positive
it was not these comments are based on the first episode only,positive
the plot was quite different from what i had expected but still quite good,positive
this movie was amazing it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movies by director writer,positive
the story is definitely something you havent seen before which is good,positive
that is what i think when john was still around i really didnt laugh as much as i do now it is too bad that no more are being made i dont think because i would love to see some new material,positive
better than those other shows if youre like me and you love comedy this is probably a show for you go watch and see,positive
everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it why not enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been,positive
i like this movie old will sit and watch the whole movie its not oscar material but definitely entertaining,positive
this is my favorite movie of all time its great but then again i guess he was,positive
i have to say that i havent expected that this movie to be this good watch it you will definitely enjoy it,positive
this movie was well done but it also made me feel very down at times as well,positive
said weird things or was it just a crazy dream you never know think great acting of all the cast,positive
all kids need some kind of hero they play themselves as they played their parts in the series rent it buy it very well done,positive
well this is the best comedy movie i have ever seen my both favorite actors did good job all other was also good in this movie so must watch movie excellent job by actors and director,positive
i liked the relationship between the father and son nice work,positive
i would like to see much more of this show it is very entertaining mr i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show it is well worth your time,positive
that being said the film is also excellent basically the story is about the old man and the boy and the film needs little else,positive
its a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the us if only more people could see it,positive
why but this is a good good good thing when it comes to entertainment how could you not enjoy the following but what about the story you ask but then again that is the beauty of this film where did he come from,positive
this movie was a classic if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did,positive
its not perfect but its definitely very enjoyable it was a long time coming and its well worth the wait,positive
is not a bad movie but the acting and the screenplay can be better i like this movie because i have a life that is in good part like the one in the movie,positive
is that possible they sure knew who she was after act i people its better than it sounds,positive
love is a strange thing without it love will not last long one of the best romance movies,positive
this is one of the best films ever made this film is worth your time to see my only question is why arent there more films like this one,positive
i but not in this play well worth watching over and over,positive
it gets a very high rating from viewers why then has it not been released on video,positive
you should definitely see it if you havent already it was so great,positive
and so it was i found mr i think mr,positive
really was for me at least its number one now,positive
the acting is bad the storyline fails but it is still a fairly nice movie to watch why do not expect anything like i said just see it for yourself and you know what i mean this is all i wanted to say,positive
then you will enjoy this one and last but not least the setting is what made the film for me,positive
so its got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this take the time and check this out well worth a two hour viewing,positive
still the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films ive seen for quite some time,positive
i really enjoyed this movie it is good to see a new face i believe she will go far i cant wait for the sequel,positive
i miss him on the other shows movies he was in,positive
but it was a happy surprise ill definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd,positive
it doesnt have any cheesy moments and the love story isnt a waste of time the music and songs are also well done,positive
most of the fight scenes are pretty decent ok so you could do better but,positive
the soundtrack of the english version is also very good,positive
i am also a big fan of the music used overall this film is hilarious,positive
oh boy my god what a movie this one i have seen all the comment for this movie the plot and the script are completely perfect watch it,positive
if you are alone i would not recommend that you watch this both actors were very good in their parts i gave this a high rating i highly recommend this story,positive
i hate because i have reason this is a great film i recommend it to all,positive
this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time the ending of the movie is very different from most movies i look forward to seeing more movies from him,positive
its a crime that he did not in fact all of the acting in this film is excellent,positive
is the plot over the top yes yes well you have to watch and see it never lets up and it took me by surprise the first time i saw it,positive
seriously if youve only seen it once it deserves another viewing,positive
the best thing on it is a great great actor,positive
all in all great movie go see it its great go buy it,positive
when i was young i had seen very few movies so what did i do what happened in the end how did i get the money in the end i never saw the film the head that didnt die and the rating i gave it is my life rating its doing pretty good,positive
i thought this was a very good movie im sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending thats why this made this move such a good movie i really enjoyed watching this movie and i still do now when it comes on i seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on,positive
i watch a lot of movies a lot of movies mostly because i feel i have seen it all from what it is to how its put together its fun and its stupid but also brilliant in its weird little way,positive
all the same man and all so incredibly different now those two made some beautiful music,positive
i heard an interesting story about this film has anyone ever seen this footage,positive
overall the performances were crazy its a movie sit down watch with an open mind and laugh your head off,positive
but the film has a sequel only god can take the life of a person away,positive
one of those films i have no problem watching when it is on tv,positive
but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already,positive
this movie didnt really surprise me as such it just got better and better well well see how he does but i couldnt find his number this was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything lets see if i dont like it i dont have to watch it,positive
i have seen this movie only once several years ago could have been better but it also could have been a lot worse,positive
then when i saw it it was actually quite good i do recommend it,positive
there it begins the actual thriller dance is amazing the whole thing seems movie like and it really is actually rather scary,positive
a movie that just has so much character to it that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become as far as quality goes for sure,positive
well okay maybe not perfect but it was pretty close i guess im saying that i liked this movie quite a bit,positive
apparently people either like this movie or just hate it and im one who liked it,positive
i watched this movie a long time ago but ive always loved it i hope you enjoy,positive
perfect or the fact that he did it pretty easily,positive
just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies,positive
and the movie also gives you a great behind the scenes look of how television is made,positive
it keeps my attention i think it is very important to have the right cast of any show because thats what makes any show a success and of course the scenes and the show itself i love to watch some comedy action suspense and romance,positive
well no one one thing that is true though about mr not that that mark is bad,positive
we all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents i havent heard them laugh like that in years it was the first time that i can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy,positive
most tv shows didnt have any point and thats not bad sometimes,positive
this is an excellent movie and i would recommend it to everyone mr cant give away any of the suspense or drama found in the movie hell to pay is a must see movie i would watch this movie over and over again because it has all the elements of a great western movie,positive
if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know,positive
you could read lots of stuff about the movies plot before hand but you dont really need to we also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place,positive
i think she falls in love with him but she also tries to kill him as do a number of hot women in the film the film has a lot to it too much to list excellent,positive
it was an interesting and entertaining movie well worth watching,positive
this movie is amazing i will watch it again and again,positive
this movie was great and i would like to buy it please if anyone knows where i can buy this movie let me know,positive
this movie is horrible but you have to see it because of that go and buy this one,positive
its a great movie i watch it with the girls every time,positive
since i have never seen this film before i wanted to check it out,positive
in fact most of the dialog takes place over the story rather than having characters talk to one another,positive
if you cant then you probably wont like this film very much at all its worth seeing despite not being especially believable,positive
over her dead body was a nice little movie it was decent and entertaining while still being pretty funny at first i didnt think it was going to be good at all when it started out it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was i dont see how this movie was bad its rating is just a bit too low,positive
it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either,positive
if you are looking for a movie that doesnt take itself seriously he has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh the soundtrack is just as good,positive
now this is more like it one of the best movies i have ever seen,positive
i still think its a great film but it could be better than great,positive
i guess my husband and i are a little slow,positive
im not a big tv person i dont miss the show for nothing so i will hope for a second third and who knows how many more episodes its a really good show very funny and entertaining,positive
i was not let down we soon learn that we were wrong all along,positive
im actually going to buy this on dvd when i find it,positive
young mr ill say no more in fact young mr,positive
finally its about time hollywood got their act together go figure its a masterpiece what would you do i always thought this would be made for the big screen cant wait,positive
so many people have seen this film and just dont get it and i dont understand why,positive
but not bad for hollywood the actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them not just one or two and shes good,positive
a young boy and his mother are away from home he,positive
i dont know why the final bit of the film doesnt work at all there is a lot of that,positive
i mean they have a lot to live up to dont they as i say a lot to live up to so now we have the film and well a film is different isnt it so why is it brilliant well i cant remember but that would be telling,positive
probably our favorite character in the entire movie part of that has to do with the writing or never cast her to begin with,positive
ill start off right at the beginning by saying i like this movie and what a story it is does he i wont tell still she wasnt that bad ive seen worse i said it before and ill say it again i like this movie i recommend it,positive
this was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up see it with an open mind,positive
the ending was so sad love this movie same story line young guy falls for older women older women falls for young guy to,positive
i think just because i had heard a little bit of this movie hes just great classic,positive
but i was wrong so i was surprised by the story in fact i thought it was quite good except for the predictable end it just looked real i think,positive
but i hope not for those that have not seen it see it,positive
its about real people a real time and place its real life,positive
its hard enough moving away from home and being forced to live in a small room with someone you dont even know then come to find out what didnt she have oh thats right,positive
i was very young when it came out but i remember the first time i saw it this is a very cheesy movie but a great one,positive
the movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based,positive
shes finds out where hes from from a story by the director,positive
when i finally got around to seeing it i thought it was an entertaining documentary who knows,positive
it is not the best or the most why i would like to understand it myself look at all the time that we have but we miss it i love this town and the world the we live in,positive
the nice thing about this series is that its totally new the result of that is that its a series which does not let you go,positive
you will die hes not in a lot of the movie but when hes there you know whose movie it is,positive
this is by far one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time this is the one it is real and powerful but this movie is so much more than that,positive
and indeed she is sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said this is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort,positive
do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point,positive
i love lost but will it ever end would it happen possibly probably i hope they do another series but after reading some of the previous comments it would appear not,positive
i was a kid he was and is the greatest of all times few days ago a friend gave me a present i just couldnt believe it so i took my time and saw the movie again i didnt because you gave me great moments with your music all the best to you where ever you are out there,positive
this show is a classic great lines characters and good acting,positive
the acting is fantastic and the script is even better i cannot believe this is his first real film,positive
why would i say that the movie was hilarious i thought this movie was great something to do with life and of course any kid movie trying to do that is in over its head but for once i didnt care if you havent watched it do so youll like it,positive
i believe i can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts,positive
i can think of many many horror films that are worse than this one,positive
i thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it i highly recommend it,positive
something surprised me about this movie it was actually original,positive
i dont think i could watch that again once is plenty,positive
i was expecting a lot from this movie and i can say i havent been disappointed,positive
that being said i would like to say that despite the fact that the main characters are gay this is not a story about being gay,positive
all of the other main characters do a fine job as well,positive
i dont know guys the acting is pretty nice as well man how cool is that,positive
the plot is second to none this is sci fi,positive
though not really an art house film its too short,positive
see it and it may change your way of life,positive
b either way this film makes you look forward to seeing more of their work,positive
it is not a comedy though it has its laughs,positive
and the setting was the kind i would like so i started to watch it at first i expected a serious drama film and it seemed like so for a while,positive
the story has been told before this person could be working next to you,positive
okay okay maybe not the greatest its okay he saw it on the television anyway you get the point had jack always been there like mr,positive
i totally loved this movie tried to buy it and cant find it thats what makes this movie so good,positive
and look how a true story with a little help of its friends,positive
why havent i seen more of him someone give him more roles please,positive
the movie is different from the book but in my eyes its still a beautiful piece of work as is the book its a great movie with a great story line,positive
i mean that i do believe that everyone should see this movie though i truly do,positive
and i loved it those i guess were the days,positive
i love this show it is amazing i can never miss an episode even if ive already seen it the actors are perfect for the parts even their parents watch it now,positive
some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part i didnt expect it is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie,positive
i was a bit surprised about that fact because the story of that movie is absolutely boring if it had no story the film would be better,positive
in a middle of a war his acting is so great he gets into the character so well there characters or similar in this film he is just a little more,positive
what makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies i was thinking a long time about that some try to be good some gave up trying to be good,positive
this movie is for anyone that wasnt around during that time period,positive
well i dont know much about anything but i sure liked this film in other words it was everything it set out to be,positive
this was actually a fun movie other than that the movie is good fun but she still looks beautiful go see,positive
this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time,positive
but lets take a look on the other side what do you see and whats the right thing in my opinion thats the writer of the story and the director tried to tell us by the way,positive
i wont list the songs in case you want to be surprised more power to them which brings me to my second and main reason i hate it the video editing is terrible in my opinion,positive
it somehow works and doesnt work at the same time,positive
this great film has both too bad they dont make films like this more often,positive
this was such a great film i loved how it was a question of do you need me us now,positive
some get it others do not interesting i see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways,positive
the characters are real and all of the performances are perfect,positive
except a plot and good actors t s t s is so bad its good,positive
i remember when i first saw this movie now on with the review the soundtrack is memorable with some very funny songs and a couple of cheesy love songs,positive
how can this be see it for yourself to find out the rest of the story,positive
and the ending oh my god this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series,positive
i was expecting a classic film with lots of war,positive
have not seen this movie on tv at all and would love to own it on dvd,positive
went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend etc,positive
characters and the music your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once great job and now to the actors,positive
this was one of those movies like many on here i remember seeing it as a child and loved it,positive
you can even read about him in the original book,positive
basically the killing of the child in this film is not the main theme of the movie,positive
its such a good movie its such a beautiful place i love love stories they are so fun to watch i like to watch them because it is nice to watch people fall in love,positive
what more could anyone want i really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy,positive
not to say that its a brilliant film by any means but its definitely worth a watch however since this is a horror film since when do we care about plot its fun,positive
this one man show may be the most fantastic show ive ever seen,positive
why did we take to this movie we enjoyed the movie enough to look for a dvd,positive
it was at times funny but it could have been better,positive
i saw this movie in the theater when it came out i think it is a fine romance and i am not gay not that there is anything wrong with that,positive
sure it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world,positive
no maybe not to everyone but to me it is and always will be dr,positive
i loved it it was a terrible movie i loved it i cant either to tell the truth now the movie is terrible the special effects are terrible the acting is terrible but i loved it,positive
and tv never seem to show it if you ever get the chance you would be silly to miss this it is a wonderful film a must see for everyone,positive
scene in fact youll enjoy the whole movie ten stars,positive
this certainly wasnt the worst movie i have ever seen i just dont know who to recommend it too,positive
did they just now care about getting people to see this film,positive
the camera work which seemed to place the viewer together with the characters in the scene this is one hell of a great movie,positive
how do you know if a movie is good or not i dont know if i will be strong enough to watch it again,positive
this movie is a great this is a movie you can watch over and over again i love this movie,positive
she gives one of the best performances of the year,positive
had my work cut out for me for a long time things was fine for a while we have had three years of this you can stop it now,positive
i find this movie enjoyable not only by the elements of humor but also the music in various scenes,positive
one of the most important movies of all time it is a piece of american history,positive
the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is beauty,positive
actually i have more a question than a comment does anyone know the story on that the story of these boys was amazing i never knew that,positive
i love how the parents have no idea how to deal with the kids,positive
this is the movie ive seen more times than any other i believe i saw it on average once every year since it was released,positive
the movie may be great the book is so much better than the movie that i was disappointed with the film,positive
not so well written beautiful cinematography i think not this movie wasnt too terrible but it wasnt that much better than average not that its wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that i mean come on too bad,positive
okay sorry but i loved this movie ive never seen another movie like this one well not horror anyway but the only part that disappointed me was the very end it could have been left off or thought out better,positive
and it works the film is also very slow moving which in this case is a good thing the question thats it went though my mind that will be interesting,positive
the acting is superb you will love all the acting special effects and much much more if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now,positive
let me just say i was not disappointed at all,positive
i absolutely love it i was so sad they took the show off air,positive
i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure youre in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply,positive
michael is a simple but fairly original and easily enjoyable romantic comedy come on the film is not that bad in fact i found it quite funny and memorable sure its not the best thing youll ever see but its still good out of,positive
its too bad a lot of people didnt understand this and the next episode second part is what happens in real life,positive
kids of whatever age do not want to know about their parents sex lives no easy out here,positive
it really shows s i get this show if you can well worth it,positive
i dont know maybe i just didnt care for this one at all its just the question of how,positive
thats the point i wouldnt be surprised if i turn on the tv in the near future and see a show not to far from this,positive
in fact i now kind of like and expect them,positive
its not a movie for everyone he had such a good sense of humor about the role,positive
acting this film is a very well acted film he sets up every shot so that nothing is left out but it doesnt stop there his work on this movie made it what it is,positive
i just loved mr i have to say i loved the show,positive
thats another thing that makes this film stand out for me the characters,positive
what a brilliant film this was too good to be made for tv,positive
i highly recommend this movie and will see it again im sure,positive
of course i dont need to tell you what happens after that this is probably my favorite tv movie this movie also has the best acting that i have seen in tv movies she seems to be exactly like her character everyone seems to love this movie,positive
also it doesnt matter how nice you are you cannot make someone like you girls boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise we all know a david fun guy who makes you laugh,positive
i just had to write about it i have never seen anything like it all the other actors are very good too i dont care what anyone says about this movie i just love it and love it the scenes and mr this movie is now a part of me,positive
most of the supporting cast is well known at least by face if not name and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film the fantastic mr,positive
this is a great family film its fun and entertaining,positive
it is by far the movie of all movies and well there was the book first is there a point in making a sequel one to watch,positive
beautiful because she is the love of his life fall in love,positive
maybe because i didnt expect anything at all when i watched it i didnt know anything about it either that was probably a good thing this is a film that you apparently either love or hate the story is weak most people say it is a film you will enjoy watching or hate its as simple as that,positive
and i love it im one of the guys who didnt understand the story at all but this was still a great flick to watch just fantastic,positive
its just kind of an older version of it takes two,positive
i feel it is worth seeing again yes she can act not too hard,positive
one thing is for sure you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day a good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end,positive
in short real life and perhaps thats why its been lost,positive
i just cant understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense it was never supposed to make sense dont tell me they cant act because they most definitely can they can also write now where was i,positive
well in this film she looks perfect another point i didnt like was on opening night it just doesnt make sense,positive
a tale of will power the acting performances are all excellent i recommend this to anyone who finds the subject interesting and or fans of those who made it,positive
the movie is a very good movie the screenplay is brilliant the story is excellent,positive
just got out and cannot believe what a brilliant documentary this is i didnt know a thing about this before going into it and what a surprise the people tell the story,positive
if you havent read the book you should really find a copy,positive
hes not acting give this film a go and you wont be disappointed,positive
the character development was also pretty good with some superb performances the directing is great good job there is a little bit of gore the acting is great overall a must see,positive
both did quite a few movies together back in those days of which this one is probably their best known one,positive
but it is funny you would have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it,positive
its a truly well made television movie i recommend it most highly,positive
old on tv she let me every minute of this film and saw it over and over in my mind i always looked for it but never found it so,positive
who said it had to be believable youll enjoy the experience much more very good film,positive
if you got a chance to see this movie do it,positive
if i was a film director that would be the kind of thing id like to do,positive
let me just say i was not disappointed at all,positive
i hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as i did,positive
i thought this movie was great if you didnt take it too seriously plus mr,positive
a good film that will get you talking with your friends,positive
i think i am and then they could have got home in a film,positive
written by someone who has been there you can tell but only if youve been there maybe they will realize how hard it is to die or to watch someone you love die,positive
best all around soundtrack and musical score ive ever heard,positive
but the best gore scene happens inside the house and i have to admit this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen so what to think of all of this,positive
from the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs what makes this movie special you say,positive
i really enjoyed the characters in the movie its quite something i have never seen before in any movie the story is almost non stop from beginning to the end there are no boring moments and i thought the acting was great so if you want to see a fun movie a great movie,positive
once you start to watch you dont want to miss anything enjoy,positive
it is fantastic i loved especially the dark humor scenes which made laugh the whole theater this movie is a must see for everyone,positive
the movies cast all acted really well the two actors really worked together rather well there is a bunch of stuff that happens in the movie which you dont know what is going on and what is going to happen next and this movie keeps you going from beginning to end,positive
there are many of characters and almost all of them are very interesting,positive
i guess we have to and then they are never to be seen again and in how many films has anyone ever done that s,positive
yes the plot is so so but that isnt the point,positive
life appears very good both are great fun and quite over the top,positive
to me it is a story with a beginning middle and end a i may be way off great i didnt understand it so it never gets old enjoy,positive
i find this show quite funny and i enjoy watching it we never see him we only hear him,positive
the story is unique as is the movie or so this film is actually quite good as far as it goes,positive
s i should think were going to hear more about him in the future,positive
but it was time for it to end and the story to move on,positive
i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband the movie is long but its fantastic,positive
its a kids movie but like i said its a kids movie it doesnt matter to kids if the acting animation or script is fantastic or even good all they care about is what happens to the characters if not then its bad you all know what i mean you were all kids once,positive
i love this movie i think many people will enjoy it its nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy as others in this society,positive
is going to be fun in this case in the future like i said its dumb,positive
was it believable no it was a funny two hours no doubt,positive
i cant imagine anyone else who could come close i enjoyed the whole cast i wish id written it,positive
whats up with that ending im not sure what else to say other than its horrible,positive
in this movie there is no bad guy he knows exactly what he did but as he says in the film you want a why but maybe there isnt one maybe this is something that just happened there is a why but we dont find out about it until the end by the end of the movie you realize just how far he would go to help them,positive
it is clear in this film that you are not alone,positive
why this material was never released before is beyond me,positive
this is easily the best thing on tv right now,positive
lets face it still i like this movie without the right actors this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel id definitely recommend this movie to everyone,positive
my kids loved this movie we watched it every chance we got it was fun a fun movie we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again even after all these years they remember it but seriously it is a fun movie and worth watching,positive
i hope to get back to see the film a second time,positive
but the story that it tell and maybe the ending the most are serious indeed so the movie works as a comedy if you want one and a much more serious one if you want that,positive
this is a good movie a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book you will be very very disappointed the acting is ok probably the worst part of the movie i was able to watch this movie without looking at the time sometimes overall this was a good family movie with some weak points,positive
now to the plot there were a few thing i did not understand in the movie i think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short i liked the boy overall a good movie,positive
this was a nice film what is interesting though was that it makes you ask about your own life are you really doing what you really love definitely worth a watch,positive
what a movie and the story one of the best movies of all time,positive
i thought i knew my history apparently i didnt know it at all,positive
so what do i think about the film its good,positive
i have to say that the new show works very well a good show,positive
just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone,positive
she started acting as a small child that and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days,positive
if you dont have any of these you can not understand it and if you dont understand you cant enjoy it,positive
fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting,positive
this is a very well written movie full of suspense right up to the end,positive
its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends,positive
i found it enough about me more on the movie you have to watch it for yourself get the dvd now,positive
this movie surprised me the only problem i had was with the plot i know that this is done to add some serious drama but it just is,positive
oh what fun there is here recommend it to a friend,positive
i must admit i love it really a must but,positive
i had definitely not got what i had expected and i had actually already seen the film,positive
you know the rest of the story anyway dont you but even if you watch this movie up to its end you will not be disappointed,positive
it is also hilarious you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isnt the best a must see i highly recommend,positive
who ive played them over and over it was a complete success my first doctor was doctor no mr i didnt know of mr who but i do now we have already seen that he is a great actor,positive
the main thing against the film is its long running time still the movie is never boring,positive
even for sci fi this movie is movie is a little out there my first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind its different not a hollywood ending overall good flick,positive
my god this is funny stuff well what are you doing up then and the fight sequences are second to none,positive
another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever but i wont give that one away oh no,positive
but i have seen that movie many times since i was a kid s,positive
if you get the chance to see this take it,positive
out with the old and in with the new shes a good actress let me get that out of the way but so is everyone else in the film actually there isnt that much sex it could easily have been turned into a rather slow boring romance worth it,positive
i first saw this movie when i was very little i loved it there are people who say its badly written and all that but its a kids movie and things like that dont matter much to children i loved the story and especially liked the songs and all the female characters youre only a child once so dont let them miss out on this one,positive
there are so many more you can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too but back to the main characters some of the main characters were brilliant this is all not to say the show didnt have some bad episodes it had plenty,positive
however ill try enjoy if for what it is people a well above average action film i could go on but ive made my comment,positive
was this based on a comic book a video game nothing and then we have some more bad dialog and after that some more great action very silly good get off my back id hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i,positive
the songs are great the actors are very good and the message this film is a real masterpiece,positive
the story line is great and much better then the films for kids today,positive
this is a different kind of film and well acted,positive
first of all i should not this film had no script the dialogue is almost completely written by the actors,positive
hes average at best thats all everyone should check it out,positive
how could this be i never thought id watch it the story is based on a book and you can tell may be its that performances that do it im pretty sure in must have been this movie was good for no reason,positive
first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes because of this movie i do now but im not so sure thats a good thing everything here no one really needed to know that is definitely so not true and very very sad that wasnt too great oh well,positive
but kids love this stuff the music is old but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it,positive
ending watch for yourself although this is hard to find i had to pay a little more than usual for this dvd it is definitely worth your money,positive
it may not be oscar material however this was a very funny film,positive
quite ridiculous in fact it could only happen in a dream,positive
overall the film is ok brilliant i love the song both the song beautiful,positive
she left her parents house and got a job they are best friends i highly recommend this show i love it,positive
better she should see it on a tv than not at all,positive
he was the film and for me this is the best role that he has ever played i wish they made more movies like this,positive
the direction is excellent the character development in the movie is first rate it is a dark movie with quite a few sex scenes a top rate movie,positive
i was not disappointed it is such a dark story which i guess is why i like it and what is better than the dead coming to life and most important to me,positive
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this i think not you need only put them together all that has been said here needed to be said so be it now said,positive
i found the storyline in this movie to be very interesting the acting was also superb,positive
the kids love it and the parents hate it i was still thinking about how good that last song was,positive
but i want to add a few words the premise now we have it on dvd it was never about sex its about coming of age,positive
i really liked the movie other than that a pretty good movie,positive
i dont know exactly how old he was but he didnt act like a child well done,positive
as dramatic as events were this could have been a very boring political drama it didnt take long to figure out who everyone was and what their roles were,positive
first things first this isnt an action movie although there is a lot of action in it i was surprised how funny this movie was go see this wonderful feel good movie,positive
this movie is fantastic the way the film was directed was great the director took his time to set everything up i thought the movie was just a drama ive never done this before but this is the main reason i liked the movie but for a film to do that its great,positive
or so i thought but still you can very clearly sense that the cast apparently had a lot of fun making this movie,positive
about a year ago i finally gave up on american television,positive
i love bad movies but this is really bad bad acting bad special effects very stupid story bad direction actually everything is bad in this movie,positive
i will certainly be looking into their other films i truly love this film,positive
i have said it in other comments but i must say it here can you picture that,positive
i really liked this film not a great movie but an enjoyable one,positive
i didnt understand it that well but as i saw it more and more times i started to love it i love the songs in this movie my favorite songs are let me be surprised and soon youll come home those are beautiful songs when i was little my sister couldnt even watch that part other than that this movie is wonderful,positive
i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies ill simply say i like it,positive
look well what can i say well worth your time,positive
the performances are there but nothing amazing the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work in the end i wanted more from this one,positive
game over it really makes the movie believable and memorable keep it up bill,positive
this is the only one that will never go back,positive
there are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie,positive
thats still being done today amazing the writer the famous dr nothing hilarious here but it wasnt meant to be,positive
but on top of that he also was a great actor really a movie that deserves to be seen,positive
sometimes i just want to laugh dont you dont want to admit you liked it fine,positive
whether you will enjoy or hate this movie really comes down to what kind of humor you have i cant wait for the sequel,positive
pretty hard to believe but this was based on a true story,positive
what do you mean son of actor not an actor,positive
i didnt know anything about this movie before i watched it,positive
but so what the film made me care about the characters and i dont ask any more than that from an actor,positive
if youre not a fan of the old series youll hate this,positive
he is a true actor they need each other this is something special,positive
then again what do i know im only a child,positive
and nor does he not so all of that is interesting enough,positive
now this is what im talking about is it real a film that makes you think is not one to avoid,positive
of course been done before many times predictable yes worth watching i am a great fan of mother daughter stories although this is not the best of its genre i will buy it and watch it again,positive
try it you may like it more than you think,positive
if youre a fan of action films this has it all dont miss it,positive
this movie would have been better off without both the movie is based upon a tv series that was out four years before the movie that in itself wouldnt be much of a problem,positive
its not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie as im not sure it makes a great deal of sense just sit back and enjoy,positive
first its a scary horror movie a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan what will happened with the lives of our all american family but thats just my opinion something is for sure,positive
comment but there is a one big shame so we will watch this movie again once upon a dream or,positive
i would have to say this is a great movie if you do not enjoy the humor then look at it from a different point of view and watch it again,positive
we know how these things work everything comes together at the end and it did maybe a little too nice but most of all this movie makes you feel and that is the most important thing i dont know about you guys but that does not happen that often,positive
it has rich characters who are believable as well great acting great writing and although the music got a little cheesy i even liked that,positive
but it really was a worth while watch the atmosphere of the film is also great this movie did all those things to me and more,positive
it was always fun and always funny its always entertaining,positive
everything about the movie was amazing all were perfectly cast,positive
he makes this person up named mr overall a pretty funny flick,positive
it keeps an air of reality which is important in a film like this i didnt want it to end thats what a good film does to a person if it has done its job you wont want it to end,positive
but when does enough become too much the supporting cast brings the story together,positive
if you havent seen it get it if you can,positive
i feel that this is a great movie for them to watch i will love to show this movie,positive
this film is full of interesting ideas some scenes are truly hilarious,positive
not by a long shot excellent acting but im a horror fan through and through,positive
i watched it for the second time with my children they absolutely loved it,positive
one of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story hilarious it has some great character actors in it too i remember him from head of the class i will definitely buy it,positive
this film was quite a surprise so what the story isnt all that interesting it is the usual tale of love found and lost,positive
the acting also is good it was hot and funny at the same time the soundtrack is nice too i didnt hear too many songs but the ones i heard i liked,positive
lost is one of a kind i have never seen any tv series like this before,positive
this was an excellent movie its a great story about love and family i will not give away any of the plot but this is a well made film and i would watch it again if i had the chance i hope you can enjoy this film as i did,positive
i highly recommend it to anyone i still say the book is better than the movie but the movie gives the book a run for its money,positive
love the characters and the story line very funny with plenty of action i highly recommend this movie if you like mr a you will love this movie,positive
it just funny watch it ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious anyway just watch the movie if you get a chance,positive
how to play around with that and create something more interesting badly with her the acting is great as far as pretty much everyone goes the humor doesnt always work however for the most part the film was funny those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes,positive
he just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewers mind,positive
but the dialog is just bad at times but thats really about all,positive
the lack of money shows does anyone care too much,positive
yet if you like this kind of thing that is,positive
this movie is beautiful in all ways it is completely perfect but only if you understand what youre going to experience,positive
i certainly didnt i can easily understand why there are people who dont like this movie and thats also the reason why i will not say that these people dont have a heart or things like that but why should you watch it then i would also like to add that this movie really had it all its one of the very best movies ive seen in a long time,positive
i cant think of another actor who would have been better no i dont think so,positive
this movie is very funny acting is good comedy is great they are up to their usual thing,positive
and that is just what they did great performances from all the actors and each one was well cast in their roles you will love it,positive
i just love this show its so funny and cool,positive
this show is actually pretty good like all shows on tv it has its good episodes and its bad ones,positive
this short has all the elements of a great movie the dialog is so real the acting is superb most go thats it and the ending made me love it more great,positive
i loved this movie can we expect more lets hope so,positive
but before i go i want to talk to you yes well let us begin i love you more than you loved that guy,positive
but he makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to say he makes it fun for us too,positive
so what is it that makes this movie a near classic,positive
he finds both but not in the way he had expected t,positive
but the film works the look and feel of the film is perfect,positive
we have seen this type film many times over the years there are beautiful women as well but no sex scenes the acting is near perfect by all production is first rate as well,positive
in the title the deep i highly recommend you watch this series,positive
we would wait for that line in all of his movies classic,positive
it is one of the great comedy characters in film,positive
i own a copy of this film and have always loved it they must have made the film at about the time i saw the show what a talent ten out of ten,positive
the voice acting for me was what made the movie all in all this is a good movie,positive
also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode,positive
by the end of the picture its nearly become a complete drama,positive
i really liked this movie of course the idea is pretty much out there,positive
i highly recommend this one the direction is very good the acting is wonderful she was amazing rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one,positive
they live together and are living the dull life she has a lot less experience at first he is not really into it good movie,positive
okay this wasnt the greatest horror movie ive ever seen in my life,positive
great film i cant wait to see it on the big screen again,positive
actually the supporting cast is a whos who of television best character actors,positive
there are many fine supporting actors dont miss this brilliant movie to me this is what great film making is all about,positive
what is the reason why so many people hate this movie he really looked ill and old which he also of course was,positive
this movie is hard to find but if found you must see the acting is great very believable sad movie,positive
this movie is not oscar type of movie but it has at least a good point of view of what life is like for young people or for real people,positive
it really is a great song about new york city as well hes great too,positive
the movie is very fun and funny and it has superb moments,positive
i think that although the acting isnt all that great its really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script it is now by far my favorite movie of all time,positive
its a new beginning the old boring style has gone now its something else they are unique you will hear some music at some point please just keep your head straight and leave your body free,positive
ive seen this movie more than once the acting is good and the characters are more real than most in low budget sci fi,positive
im sure the movie would have been much different to me if i had not read the book,positive
first i would like to say how great this they cant get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party,positive
although this is not one of their best it is an excellent musical excellent art direction and score,positive
ive a feeling ill be watching this again and again for years to come,positive
they dont want you to have hope for the future or to think you have a chance,positive
this isnt just a fun movie or a well made movie mr mr mr the two make up and go out to the movies and the movie they watch is mr,positive
first time i ever saw this was at a friends house,positive
liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy,positive
can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode,positive
it is pretty dumb but it is also a lot of fun the acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good there is not much plot just lots and lots of gore,positive
but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep,positive
he was a human being after or during scenes as it was written back to this,positive
but i actually thought about this one on the way home it is the kind of movie that you keep watching and always enjoy,positive
they dont believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way this is a movie you do not want to miss watch it it will be worth it i even own the dvd its that good,positive
very good film very good documentary how does it feel,positive
it is the truth it is the best bad movie ever,positive
you would never be able to guess who the killer is,positive
in a word they have character that is not so the history was right on the mark its a nice little film,positive
the series had a good premise and great actors its really really a shame,positive
if you watch t then you might as well not watch the movie just dont go see this movie expecting to be surprised,positive
i loved this movie and i am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it or so it seems,positive
loved the movie i even liked most of the actors in it ive always thought of her as an actor that plays herself no matter what role shes in,positive
i liked the film also the film is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too,positive
the beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out,positive
this movie have good plot good acting and interesting ideas,positive
it is amazing absolutely amazing see the movie it is great,positive
of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already thats my favorite scene of the film its brilliant its total entertainment,positive
im serious watch the movie thats all im going to say best movie,positive
i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well it was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time a brilliant start and i am going to love what will come next we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it,positive
i havent been disappointed gives this movie a great interest watch it if you can,positive
you dont want to mess with her is as fun as any,positive
this film has been one from the heart for the heart,positive
amazing and now im going to watch it all over again,positive
i have seen almost all of the films except for die another day and the world is not enough this one is definitely the best finally mr yes i can at long last hes a great actor mr,positive
who knows anyway the movie was very worth seeing love your sister,positive
both of us fans of t much too short though,positive
this is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written etc this is one of them and its a must have,positive
this series dont seem to be quite as serious as the first one there are much more comedy in this good one though by all means lot of fun but it makes you take the series a little less serious its well written but some of the new elements are just kind of silly but they save it by making it more like a comedy they are all very good all over id say effects are from ok to good the music is also quite good as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well all together this makes a good sequel however i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this,positive
where i found the time for this i have no idea this show is great i hope the rest of it is as good,positive
i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god not only that but also as a black man,positive
anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie he has something big to say this one looks like its never even heard of the word he always has something to say usually at the same time but for him its not just business,positive
the plot well there really isnt one as many have said its a shame that the film found no audience,positive
i have enjoyed watching it again too though i have to admit it is not as good on a little tv i do not have older children so i do not know what they would think of it,positive
you should watch it watch it and love it i recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart,positive
this is one of my least favorite things about the genre i should say that i doubt most people will like the film as much as i did simply because i imagine that most people will not like or care about the characters in the same way but i still recommend it highly all the same,positive
almost every review of this movie id seen was pretty bad its not pretty bad its actually pretty good though not great,positive
most people feel that way about her you probably do to i really dont want to give too much away have fun,positive
to those of you who have not seen it yet i wont give away the ending but you should see it and once you do youll love it,positive
but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole,positive
this is entertainment after all and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well,positive
what exactly does she do again i was surprised about how good the writing was the script itself was very well put together but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team during the run of this movie from a non fan i still enjoyed this little get together good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good,positive
this movie is a real thriller the story was very well written similar to some others i have seen but quite different in several ways a must see,positive
not good and not bad either hes a very good actor and should probably be an action star or something why do they make movies like this in the first place,negative
you want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys,negative
this is quite simply one of the worst movies that i have ever seen in my life i know that even a low budget movie can be great but not this one what happens save your money and your time,negative
after all movies for free i told myself well hes done the good and the bad as far as films and tv go when they finally take off the effects are truly horrible but the horror doesnt stop there,negative
the direction is terrible the acting is so so rest of the cast are average at best overall not worth your time or money,negative
this is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesnt turn out to be a great movie,negative
there is just one word for this film some actors of quality have small parts in this film,negative
of course he has no idea what he is doing,negative
i wanted this movie to work so badly but it just didnt,negative
this has got to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think theyre doing something interesting i wonder its the best thing to do god,negative
i wanted to love this movie how could i not love it,negative
she needs a man to help her the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this even more so the comedy is simply not funny,negative
all the way though i was thinking to myself oh god why why does going into the house make her come after you it doesnt make sense you can see everything coming which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching oh shes behind her,negative
why is this one of the worst films ever come on mr,negative
imagine what this film could have been like with a decent budget,negative
what were they thinking of terrible script terrible acting i dont even feel sorry for the actors i could go on and on,negative
rock too bad the rest of the film could not have been as good as mr,negative
you know how it is well that is not true i just cant recommend this one,negative
the reviews i read for this movie were pretty decent so i decided to check it out bad idea and i didnt care about any of them perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work there were some decent scenes in it but overall this movie was a mess,negative
am i right in thinking i went to see the same film as everyone else this film was terrible someone back me up,negative
a sorry i guess that part of your life isnt over yet get well soon you half a man,negative
cinematography but why stop there the plot is just poor dialog is the less said the better characters dont get me started the more you think about this the worse it gets,negative
this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen avoid this movie,negative
but you can see it from here i definitely dont understand why anyone would recommend this movie no point to having made it really,negative
i dont really know where to start not only the acting was bad the characters were incredibly stupid as well then theres the action i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot theres blood involved times theres no blood at all well i guess thats just me to make a long story short because believe me i can go on for hours about this film this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw,negative
i dont understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him does this man have any shame what so ever what a mess of a movie,negative
i took it to my friend house to watch for movie night this movie was slow and the humor was forced dont see this movie,negative
etc save your money and your time not entertaining at all,negative
in fact this is the his first film i have seen i am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously,negative
the book its wonderful its not a masterpiece but its more than just entertaining the movie do something else,negative
at several points its difficult to know where this story is going,negative
dull characters there is nothing to her slow slow slow i am still watching the movie as i write this i cannot pay attention because it is boring,negative
i cant remember the worst film i have watched total waste of actors and audience time total waste of time,negative
its very hard to think of a worse movie with such big name actors well,negative
really a terrible movie its to be expected though either way the movies pretty bad and dont watch it if theres anything better on,negative
great etc the list goes on and on and on i wanted to like this movie a thats it period and it could have worked whats that they wanted their film to be different right,negative
yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film,negative
im not sure what it is about him but i thought his mr theres that word again,negative
still these two women most especially know whats funny and they know how to write a funny movie,negative
there is nothing new here and i have another question,negative
i know ill write one just like it where everything works out okay ill work on that,negative
we tried to get into it but the plot made very little sense even after reading the back of the dvd box over and over again the film was shot very dark and it was pretty annoying to try to figure out what was going on in each shot,negative
well what can i say otherwise stay away take my word for it the acting it really did it takes just one thought i hate you i have you,negative
in this case it does not its a joke if you ask me some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half hes the lead male so he should have some hero elements to his character but he does not i could go on but i dont want to waste my time the cover of the dvd is nice and thats where it ends just terrible,negative
no doubt she does but not in this film just a waste of movie time,negative
this film was not all that bad as the story went but the camera work is what makes it difficult to watch,negative
right from the beginning this film was ridiculous from then on it gets really ridiculous i couldnt here guess what happens next what,negative
t how anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me,negative
acting what acting production story dont get me started in this case theyre all the same guy just how did this ever get made and i did learn one thing from this film there are times when something is so very bad that it is indeed truly very funny,negative
this is the worst movie ive ever seen dont waste even a minute in your life to watch this crap they use only camera in hand dont make more movies,negative
i dont even remember how many ive seen but not to me not scary at all the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these well let me tell you,negative
well when all is said and done we dont really care,negative
what else can i say there we go now we know this movie is going to be really horrible but not even i thought it would be this bad forget this movie dont see it ever,negative
that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there however upon watching it you can quickly see what this movie really is and last and last ive played the game so why did they put it in here oh thats right this isnt a movie but a music video and its a poor one at that,negative
the only star is for her the story itself then,negative
that didnt happen god directed everything he told them where to go and what to do no no no no no god was their the whole time and he wanted the people to see he was taking care of them never actually read your story before you make up whatever you think is a good idea he was there the whole time,negative
in this case it was a big miss this movie was truly a big waste of time,negative
weak acting and very predictable nothing original about it but do not waste your time with this one,negative
there just wasnt anything good to say about it at all so whats different with the second one this one doesnt take itself too seriously etc etc,negative
i loved him in this role watch the first few scenes and then find something better or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess,negative
like a minute too late what this movie shots but whats the point i say do it s,negative
this film has the worst acting ive ever seen no i guess the actress really didnt know which guy was which which leads me to this next question what was the writer on when he came up with that did he actually expect people to understand just what the hell happened did the events we just see not happen yet or not at all i dont know overall this movie was pretty dumb s i guess he was the only person who knew this film was what it really was,negative
the supposed writer and director mr many scenes are also exactly the same,negative
and for the most part of the film not very funny,negative
the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary however i cant possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made the real horror in this film is how bad it is,negative
this is a known fact mr one weak fight scene,negative
where to start but the film on the whole is poor seriously poor,negative
the problem is with the rest of the picture s,negative
its not only one of the worst movies ive seen but it is definitely the worst musical ive ever seen,negative
why exactly was that and still pretty as a picture,negative
i wonder whether id have liked this movie when i was the characters age my guess is i wouldnt,negative
what a complete waste of time my own and everyone who was involved with this flick,negative
i could go on good no well made certainly not,negative
what the is this well actually you couldnt possible care less and why should you who after the opening credits shes the second person to die the rest of the actors,negative
this movie could have been great it is not in my opinion too much so if you ask me,negative
the effects are cheap and i do not care that the film is low budget you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent the worst film of the year so far,negative
t maybe in that sense the film works but not for me i dont think that this movie had to be dr yet i enjoy watching it,negative
in fact this film could be used in a film class to show how not to make a suspense film dont waste your time,negative
s i dont even think this deserves a star not even a half none for you,negative
just watch it for yourself try not to laugh rather its a bad film,negative
its truly awful other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well she has done better she has had better roles not me,negative
or if they have it was not very well as it should be,negative
this is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book the ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book i said close yet they left that line out in the movie,negative
the worst think i have ever seen the worse film i have ever seen and i have seen some bad ones,negative
apart from that the film was just a waste of time please dont waste your time watching it,negative
if you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay do not go see this movie otherwise dont waste your time,negative
thats just one example of how far outside of reality the play goes and in the make believe world of the theater it works,negative
lets start at the beginning what would have happened if they didnt oh man what kind of ending is that if there was ever an example of a wrong happy ending this would be it,negative
the story self also isnt exactly the greatest it isnt always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell they are really not bad actors but for some reason it doesnt show in this movie its probably also due to the poor dialog he always keeps the characters close to who he self is it by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but its not exactly one i would recommend either,negative
the acting well lets put it this way find them yourself lets release it this isnt dvd quality hell this isnt even film school quality i felt used after i saw this thing this film is the single most terrible movie i have seen however if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then i recommend you check this out you wont be disappointed,negative
great cast great acting i kept thinking it would get better but it only got worse dont believe the reviews this is a waste of time,negative
so a really cheap looking movie but i liked it anyway why because i like those kind of movies the final monster is pretty cool too im sure you will have a good time watching it,negative
now ive heard that the budget for this film was huge,negative
because it makes money thats why its well filmed but predictable and its all been done before only better,negative
for a comedy short film it got no laughs the title says it all,negative
what were people thinking when they made this film etc,negative
it is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not so what is it out of,negative
okay let me break it down for you guys its horrible what kind of line is that this movie had effort ill give you that but it was too stupid wasnt funny not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look absolutely nothing like the original cast for those of you who did like it okay what were you thinking,negative
until now in fact theres only one good guy fighting in the whole movie its up to you never see this film,negative
though being older did not seem to matter to the director that did not stop mr,negative
its really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun,negative
at least there would be a good director behind the camera take care,negative
it started out okay it is not about a fan,negative
why would anyone make a film like this sometimes there are movies that are so bad theyre good,negative
this gets old really fast also dont think the had the right actor to voice the character other than these problems the show isnt that bad,negative
but come on people what did you expect its not really as bad as it seems,negative
it seems like they dont even try to be a little funny awful awful awful show dont watch it,negative
i read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie the script was lame for the most part the acting was lame this movie was lame he looks really bad,negative
ok this horror film was meant to be a joke right please tell me it was supposed to be a joke then ill understand s,negative
what it is is a badly written and for the most part badly acted drama acting doesnt help he wasnt bad but the terrible script worked against him,negative
yes thats right maybe it was enjoyable to make but watching it just wasnt the case,negative
it may be the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen a lot,negative
a lot a lot on and on and on it wont stop it doesnt it goes on and on and on,negative
its obvious which one of the two they were more interested in,negative
a lot of the scenes just do not make sense,negative
this was probably the worst movie ever seriously dont watch it i didnt even get all the way through this movie had to turn it off,negative
there is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different,negative
her tom boy look does not really goes well even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all,negative
but other than that it was one of the worst films ever a must not see,negative
first i hate this show what a shame shes almost interesting this is a girl looking for cant live without you love,negative
weird i mean the idea was good but nothing was done with the storyline,negative
it also seems like every somewhat famous name from the era is in the cast end,negative
this is truly one of the worst movies ever made and i dont mean in a so bad its good kind of way,negative
to make a long story short this movie is boring,negative
the lines characters and acting are all poorly done from the get go if you really want to enjoy this story go rent the original,negative
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen im still trying to get over how bad it was,negative
are you following me on this but why was it in the movie i just dont know,negative
too bad that couldnt have become more of the plot oh happened oh,negative
i usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film theres really not much to talk of,negative
ive given up trying to figure out what version of this im watching its really bad whos with me,negative
she just seems to have lost face this guy is the hero you can imagine how the other characters feel about women i could go on and on but you get the idea,negative
it is somewhat we find out who it is half way through or did they,negative
lets face it this is a pretty bad film but it wont kill for him because hes using a good girl as his subject he needs a bad bad girl truly bad cinema,negative
we thought this was one of the worst movies ever also it was not realistic we did,negative
only saw this movie late last night it never went too deep i say what the hell robert was old in this movie,negative
the editing in this movie is terrible possibly the worst editing ive ever seen in a movie also the shot oh my god the shots just awful,negative
this wasnt a bad movie but i cant call it a good one either moment,negative
its very simple no why should i no why should i,negative
this has to be the worst film i have ever seen he turned into a girl but i thought it might be funny,negative
this movie is very very very poor i have seen better movies which is not a success at least if you ask me though at some points or moments i must say it was a bit funny when people got shot and how they went down they should had made it something like scary movie then it might be a better movie,negative
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i know acting is hard work and stuff but thats why it should be left to real actors the special effects in this movie were terrible,negative
oh my i just love the look on her face,negative
but in the wrong sort of way but one thing for sure she appears picture perfect throughout sorry for all that i dont buy it,negative
what is it that so many people see in this classic i dont think so,negative
obviously pretty hard i dont know it was just terrible dont see it,negative
and hollywood has done that ever since really look it up,negative
and one other thing if we might be able to add,negative
it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man,negative
would be going through your mind quite a lot nothing makes sense nor does it try too,negative
this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you dont take it seriously dont even give this film a chance and you will love it,negative
well first of all this is not the worst zombie movie there is acting is awful however as far as the plot goes they didnt work enough on the development of the story its not as bad as people say imagine a zombie western then watch this movie,negative
i admit to having been a fan of the original stage production not,negative
let me get this straight maybe thats the point there were so many things that were played down,negative
this film truly was poor it sure would have been nice mr,negative
well overall id have to say i enjoyed the movie,negative
the only good thing in this movie was the performance of mr very dumb imagine that,negative
for if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds then clearly you have another think coming,negative
or something like that why im not i get it ok again why myself a waste of two hours of my life,negative
does his character even have a point does this movie have a point it could have looked like anything maybe theres not much of a story and maybe the characters arent really very interesting but overall i actually liked the movie,negative
okay maybe not all of it but the horror the horror whatever you do do not watch this movie do what it takes never again never forget,negative
dont be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one it is but that does not a good film make others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh it isnt funny and it isnt believable for a second,negative
well thats basically all there is to this film the end i guess he wanted out of this film too rent if you must do not buy,negative
i cant say i liked this movie very much it doesnt really work as either it also doesnt make a lot of sense things seem to happen for no reason i feel like they just made things up as they were going i didnt find it boring really but like i said there there just isnt any point,negative
this is all well and good except for the fact that its boring theres really not much i can say about the film overall as there isnt much to it,negative
and yes i watched the whole thing just stay away,negative
im not sure something bad for the most part happy to say they were wrong,negative
let me start by saying that theres really no reason to watch this movie obviously this isnt supposed to be a realistic movie its supposed to be funny,negative
this one i just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long time god save us everyone,negative
this much i know would have been better the film is nothing special,negative
fact is i down right hate it i dont know any who act like any of the characters in the film the style doesnt work while it is good looking i,negative
plus the low budget shows big time the direction is terrible there is no gore the acting was terrible overall its quite simple avoid,negative
that would have been more interesting this is a movie you can take or leave,negative
he is the worst out there the acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots the editing is easily the worst do not watch this crap,negative
then the actual movie started really no you dont yes i do no you really dont yes i really do no you really really dont yes i really you get the idea i hope there is no interesting dialog,negative
i mean how could the movie really be bad person,negative
father seems to be taking it quite well i didnt particularly like beautiful thing for example but could at least see why other people did,negative
its very strange their telling horror stories to each other do not expect much of it,negative
the whole thing even takes place in just one set,negative
while the first one is a low budget classic this simply is not,negative
you could do worse but the film is still just a waste of time,negative
this movie was terrible this wouldnt be so bad if it left some suspense for the end didnt see that one coming i was disappointed because i enjoyed the first one i was but in the wrong direction,negative
horrible movie what the was it supposed to be scary it was so dumb it wasnt funny stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid do not waste your time,negative
theres no plot we dont wonder about anything we dont know how people got where they got its always amazing to me how things like this even get released i know,negative
about half way through i was saying to myself where have i seen this before there is nothing new to be seen in this production see enough movies and you really will eventually have seen it all,negative
am i really seeing that kind of way how about this plot what shes weak but she knows how to kill whats that about,negative
if they dont take it too seriously why should we unfortunately it is meant to be a horror film after all,negative
so what happened when the novel became a made for television movie dr,negative
the end seriously thats the whole movie it wasnt scary or funny or cool or anything the acting special effects and script are a joke,negative
there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through but this this is one of the single worst films ever to be made well it happens here i never found one,negative
although it is a lot better than the acting theres not much else i can say about this film its bad and not in a good way avoid it,negative
i will never get that time back never please avoid,negative
there is none that might work if there was something of interest or characters we could care about there isnt dont try to understand what some of the characters are saying,negative
this was hands down the worst movie ive ever seen in my entire life,negative
really bad but really awful really bad is too good a word for this s t but i dont want to get mean now that would have been time better spent,negative
s we should be trying our own take on the genre,negative
i told her to close her eyes and no matter what happened not to open them,negative
this movie looks like it was made for tv there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song,negative
i wanted to like this movie but there is very little to like about it so far so good well give it a chance its supposed to be a comedy okay so far so good big deal,negative
all i can say is lame really lame and by ten minutes into this movie i was too,negative
i would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh,negative
thats all the good in this boring film the dialog is incredibly bad as is most of the acting,negative
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in the cinema could not wait for it to end,negative
nothing in it makes any sense the ending was bad,negative
it is so bad i even cant write a decent comment about it but,negative
awful absolutely awful no plot no point no end every day im trying to give this video away but no one will take it,negative
this is really terrible there is nothing good in the movie,negative
this film is hilarious and it may well be the last really funny bad film ever made,negative
i had heard about this movie through a friend it was supposed to be a thriller but what i watched wasnt a thriller it was more like a weak attempt at one she did not seem into those scenes at all,negative
just doesnt make sense its all so bad it is difficult to watch,negative
i usually read reviews before i watch a movie i found it to have a total lack of story,negative
if you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box having said that lets look at the plot its almost as though the ending the one good idea in the film was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it im not sure where that came from dont waste your time,negative
every single one when will i ever learn as i said when will i ever learn and if youre reading this mr,negative
it is so easy it is just wrong s it is so because well i said so and well well,negative
i liked him better when he was fighting he man how are we supposed to take this seriously,negative
he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did especially when we meet the family for the first time,negative
what can i say i love bad tv movies love them i get involved the works i want to get involved it truly had wonderful talent of course ok direction you know i wish everyone the best really,negative
this is not one i had to fast forward through a lot of it this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits,negative
you really dont care what happened to them nothing more to say,negative
it even ends the same way as the first one,negative
away dont even think about it or something like that good things about the movie,negative
face it you cant more than a few times i really cant take it any more,negative
that was it thats all it seemed to be poor mr,negative
i dont think the message involved is good for women or gay men,negative
its clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea,negative
the rest of the movie pretty much plays out like any other zombie movie,negative
for a made for tv horror movie the movie started off very interesting but guess what there is no end,negative
put the two together and what do you get or at least i think thats what was going on,negative
and it goes from there i could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous the sex scenes are the worst i have ever seen give me a break that is a scary thought,negative
and the music was nothing great couldnt we have had a better line here,negative
hes not even killing them my god what a waste of time quickly,negative
the problem is the story maybe people do that for fun in some parts of the country but i never heard of it,negative
there is far too much sex in the film dont see this film,negative
which i dont its nice to play with them though anything but dont watch this awful flick,negative
wrong that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something what someone believe in is a matter of opinion go right for it,negative
i watched it again on tv a few years ago,negative
all in all i have seen worse but this sure isnt one id recommend or want to remember,negative
what else is there to say really what more can be said she could also act no of course not so what can we say about the new series all in all i think not,negative
however the rest of the film is awful and boring its not even so bad you can laugh about it,negative
and just when you think it cant possibly get any worse it does over and over again you actually could have watched this in a theater it wasnt worth free on tv,negative
this is a problem for a documentary whats up with that actually i think i feel for them,negative
this movie was a mess he always plays the crazy bad guy,negative
this documentary was boring and quite stupid i mean the documentary was also boring this was not worth watching,negative
you have to see this the acting is bad we had a great time after the movie truly,negative
anyway lets leave the old stuff alone dialogue in the ending leave the series alone,negative
it is not even funny all i could think was he deserves it for making such a bad movie dont waste your time or money on this one,negative
i do not see her as anything special so just for that i started watching the first episode i turned it off half way through anything else is better that that,negative
now people look at it and they say well this does not add up to this new special effects story it did have a story and a wonderful cast and a hell of a director i got to run,negative
but it was entertaining and there are several good things to say about the movie the sound is at times very cheap i kept thinking i could make a movie like this with my home video camera throughout the film,negative
no attention to camera or shots in mind this movie has one good part its end,negative
i could crap a better movie this is a waste of time and money this movie however takes this genre to a new low,negative
but it didnt work for me i dont think that this is the case here,negative
so then need i say more and why oh and by the way,negative
please for the love of god dont watch it now saying that i know what youre thinking it cant be that bad can it if everyone says it as bad as they say i have to watch it dont do it this movie must be the same right no,negative
everything this one is too much for us the only thing scary about this show is that there are people out there that take it seriously,negative
first of all what is good in the movie some pretty actress the fact that the actors dont laugh while acting i would have if i had been in their situation i dont know etc,negative
still i think you should try it at least once because as i say there are much worse movies around,negative
but no its hard to imagine who the audience is for this film,negative
and the plot its that believable or really all that entertaining either save your time and money,negative
for a comedy this movie simply isnt good or funny enough,negative
all i can say once again is give me a break,negative
kids may enjoy this more than i though i have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary,negative
acting was weak but in a horror flick i can live with that if the story is good it wasnt ok fine where ever wasted,negative
i still would not take any action against anyone involved in this film it was interesting seeing parts of my life on the big screen though,negative
it just doesnt work once again it just doesnt work at least in my eyes,negative
we have seen this type of movie i dont know how many times i felt that there was no character development and this is only the first part of the film how original,negative
this movie was just awful yet im still watching it avoid this mess of a movie better acting and more believable,negative
right now i still cant get over how let down i was by this movie i really did i had no idea what was going on let alone what it was about well ok thats what i got from it but the writing here is extremely poor telling a story im not who gave their lives to them or can i stay here instead and that ending however beauty cant save a good movie and this movie is one of those movies,negative
hell i cant really make up my mind on this,negative
say what for this i will give it one star,negative
i tried to give this show a chance but it really doesnt sit well with me although the performances are good the writing isnt,negative
the acting is the worst ive ever seen and the story line goes no where,negative
but they didnt and the audience wont but its still not enough to save the day or the film,negative
this movie was bad writing bad acting and bad directing all it told me was low budget money cant buy everything but it should in hollywood,negative
if you like crap films youll get some fun out of this one,negative
i thought both were a mess also some truly terrible acting,negative
a body part oh wait maybe not come to think of it,negative
things happen nothing makes too much sense and then it ends i mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly,negative
the short they did with the same title has more laughs,negative
with weak as water story lines you cant say anything about the acting even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script,negative
did she need the money that badly not even good bad just bad bad,negative
do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made im telling you michael is it but wait hollywood really s t all over us with this one,negative
ok i did think that it would be horrible but when i saw it whatever its pretty much all there ive just never been at a after game party in a house that big with its very own light show all in that order i must say there will be people who hate it but im not one of them,negative
this is not about truth the director wants people to think its about truth,negative
apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad,negative
this movie is most possibly the worst movie i have ever see in my entire life the plot is ridiculous and the whole little man crap is just so stupid lets face it its just a black comedy the actors have no talent what so ever how do these people get into hollywood,negative
its for the people who like to enjoy bad acting bad screenplay and bad everything else,negative
what a waste most of this movie will keep you thinking this is not what i wanted to see,negative
the first film is somewhat good to me i enjoyed it for the most part but i thought it was really nothing all that special i do have to say it was a sequel that should have never seen the light of day,negative
cant believe someone would fall for that old line but mr thats how bad i thought it was but they were awful did they actually try to play this with a straight face,negative
what is the world coming to s dont waste your time,negative
youll just have to guess what i think it sure would be interesting,negative
this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not nothing is of any interest,negative
the effects are of course poor yet parts of it especially at the beginning make it seem like theyre supposed to be in high or middle school it makes no sense,negative
thats the worst film i saw since a long time,negative
i just saw this movie and i have to say that it was a big waste of time,negative
all in all its pretty silly stuff i do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times,negative
they want everyone dead how could they possibly miss so badly so often i could go on but wont,negative
this movie was terrible the acting was awful the script was awful what was even worse were the camera shots and sound it was a complete waste of time watching,negative
they had decent special effects all star cast and good acting believe me the special effects dont help this scene and really are beyond poor which i really like as an actor but just doesnt cut in this movie,negative
i am a big fan of sci fi movies all in all an awful movie then again maybe not,negative
all in all the movie was not really worth watching,negative
this is not a horror film but a boring sex movie no plot awful acting and annoying music and believe me i am not the only one with this opinion,negative
too bad she cant act you really wont care i admit there was a twist at the end i didnt see coming but thats not enough to sit through this avoid,negative
otherwise bad will they ever get a decent job again bad bad bad but how come the sister got all the men,negative
where they meet girls and such never ever watch this movie,negative
well no not really its not really a good movie but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be the plot is ok nothing brilliant or new the acting is pretty bad but the cast is pretty id even watch it again,negative
what did your parents do something must be wrong at least,negative
what can possibly go wrong a lot youve got comedy i dont think so think not do you have a girlfriend what went wrong etc so is it an action movie a thriller a romantic comedy,negative
however as easy on the eyes as she is shes not enough to save this film not by a long shot,negative
the movie started very well i didnt know if it was a horror movie a drama one or a must not see one the make up,negative
this is a movie about making a movie would that be enough,negative
the one where she says watch my show or ill kill my dog is actually believable i just dont ever want to see her around my dog,negative
not good but definitely strange give it three stars for the cast involved,negative
sounds like the thing that wouldnt die doesnt it so for the most part i say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap,negative
this is my first review for any movie i have seen i cant believe people actually make movies like this,negative
ok let me start off by saying this isnt a horrible movie by any means its just not good no im sorry youre wrong the writing is bad but this movie has no plot there is nothing more to it just nothing,negative
there is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters sounds great dark days,negative
why both wonderful rent it and see even if thats all of it that you watch,negative
read on to find out this is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible is all over the place and is incredibly stupid you have to see this sequence to believe it i still cant believe what i saw a strange scene thats there for no reason at all,negative
and that in and of itself is saying a lot,negative
where to start i feel its not scary its not funny its not dramatic its no action its nothing or no dont watch it,negative
the girls want a rich party for their rich lives and the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one but the ending is dumb not worth my time ever again,negative
first off theres no real plot its all sort of situation comedy if it can be called that isnt this funny s,negative
what i dont remember that part i think i did they should of left well enough alone horrible,negative
saw in on tv late last night oh that scene did we need it this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched and what was the title again,negative
overall i probably wouldnt see it again but it wasnt too horrible,negative
so bad in fact that even though i didnt pay to see it i still wanted my money back which brings me to my final point,negative
there is nothing to recommend about this crap the plot is stupid all the dialogue is bad and the acting the less said the better one last thing,negative
i thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends although she is on the cover its really difficult to imagine how a film this bad got made in the first place oh,negative
my wife and i like to rent really stupid horror sci fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh now when i say this movie is awful i mean it in a good way if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one,negative
thats what the title should be anyway what happens in the movie people die is that it yes what is the plot about what plot what is the point the movie is trying to make what are the characters like is there anything good about this movie yes,negative
awful truly i dont know where to begin but this one it felt to me as though the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece give me a break i dont think so,negative
this is only the second review i have written now to the point i have seen movies with bad effects bad acting bad sound you name it and ive seen it dont watch this,negative
what were they thinking dont even think about it this film will be of no help to you,negative
what were they thinking some ideas should stay just that an idea what was so bad about it i hear you ask one word everything,negative
this is a very bad film terrible oh boy there were some really beautiful women in this film it wasnt even close,negative
this is a dumb movie were just supposed to take her word for it i guess,negative
its all the same the story was good and you wanted to know what happens next all the time if just one of these two things was good the game would be worth playing,negative
the plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people,negative
after the book i became very sad when i was watching the movie just read the book,negative
i have watched some pretty poor films in the past but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie comic book guy would be right if he said worst movie ever,negative
oh my god where to begin dont expect even a hot girl in this one,negative
there is much better material out there this one isnt worth your time,negative
just never you mind what thats used for later you probably dont want to know sometimes too much is just too much,negative
showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special,negative
the one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is he is just making her feel worse the other major people in her life are her parents her parents do nothing in her life for her,negative
in a book thats fine then i wouldnt be feeling today as i did last night when i turned it off what just happened,negative
no how dont know why sometimes bad is just bad,negative
maybe it is the ridiculous script the film has a real cheap feel about it even for a made for tv movie,negative
what was this movie about the season what it was all over the place all the time,negative
this was awful i could not wait for it to be over im fine are you sure yes,negative
which leads me to the title of my review this was cut,negative
the acting was good i dont think any of the actors did a bad job the atmosphere was great everything was well done,negative
this movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning the whole thing is so boring,negative
that said this movie is a complete mess so what does the movie have going for it period simply put the movie doesnt work or what,negative
the music being played at the same time who knows it did make me laugh theres definitely a good documentary to be made about him,negative
weak acting weak story weak script i cant recommend this to anyone did i mention how weak the acting is,negative
terrible movie just terrible not many and not much but worse,negative
i always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horror flick and said yes,negative
this was well done but the rest of the movie forget it,negative
this isnt cinema it isnt talent it isnt scary it isnt entertaining it isnt anything at all cool no wait this who is this director anyway i dont even care enough to look him up,negative
there is no way that this is a serious movie this is a must see,negative
the special effects this movie clearly didnt have a big budget what were the actors thinking did they actually believe that it was a good movie or did they just really need the money when i first saw this i was like god how old is this,negative
this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life and i have never seen such bad acting in my life i dont know what these people were thinking when they made this movie i was very disappointed the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion,negative
ok that is it have you even watched another movie form that year or any other movie in your life at all theyre actually more a thriller than this one could ever be really you guys cant be serious which i had not yet seen whatever turned it around and the plot starts with and yes,negative
thats fine with me is that even possible i dont think so the jokes were lame and not funny at all moment,negative
but if they all turned out like this that is not a bad thing other than that it really wasnt worth my time,negative
this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show,negative
i wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors,negative
unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low budget film,negative
this isnt even funny enough to be shown on tv let alone cinema,negative
i was disappointed when i saw it this show is not that good,negative
at a certain point my wife made the comment is this supposed to be a scary movie,negative
and i love all of the comments some have not gone far enough didnt help bring it on,negative
theres not much you can really say about this film except that it was crap and probably the worst film i have ever been to see,negative
why and on and on wait they never were i played that at my friends house it wasnt anything interesting maybe not sad then theres the music the music is so annoying and how do you think i know all this,negative
the special effects were something every time i heard her call out to them i would think not that face again,negative
and that is it the film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family,negative
if you like this kind of flick you could probably enjoy it on that level,negative
and very dull it needed a lot more they could of put just a little more into it,negative
i have nothing more to say but it was awful just my opinion its not even funny,negative
this movie has no plot no character development and no budget well it falls short here too,negative
that said there was only one killing in the entire movie and it was pretty lame at that did i mention it was shot on video as well,negative
some movies are so bad they are good those were the words the end there seemed to be no plot no character development and no point to the movie,negative
this movie has one of the worst lead characters ever its made for tv what do you expect it couldnt be because of the plot it couldnt be,negative
i will never get those two hours of my life back what was i thinking why i though it would be deep or about something more interesting,negative
i knew it was going to be awful but not this awful all the characters are dull and the story is stupid and incredibly boring plus the ending is especially lame the direction is horrible the acting is terrible,negative
thats about as much as i can say right now oh my god i mean i like her shes cool it was one of the worst things i had ever seen i mean dont for the love of god dont that should let you know just how crap it is,negative
the plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse,negative
you know what tried again the next day i could not watch it i love all the other stuff hes done i didnt see the one with the monster in it yet what gives is it me or him so sad s i did like the camera work,negative
i think this movie is boring and dumb but boy what a waste of time the movie on this dvd was so dark,negative
when i say better i mean the story i knew it was a straight to dvd release but i took a chance i loved the plot of the movie you would ask why he is with your son he doesnt know him you would tell him to please leave he isnt a family friend the best thing about the movie is the cover art,negative
please stay off this crap because you will save yourself nearly three hours of your life,negative
its hard to tell the actors from the non actors,negative
then again what do i know im only a child,negative
the only reason i am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie but the second half was horrible you wouldnt know it from this sorry looking bunch if you know the real story you will hate this version,negative
the script is really weak after seeing it i can now see why,negative
this is a hard film to rate because the guy is the b so i ask,negative
i hate it when people in the movie theater talk back to the screen but the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this stay with it ten minutes at least at this point i wanted mr more than a few times,negative
in this one they are the star i could be wrong on that point however because i have not seen this one in quite some time,negative
i must be that one guy in america that didnt like this movie,negative
it was actually seriously though i love bad movies i didnt know what in the world was going on was the end supposed to not make sense whatever dont ever rent or buy this movie okay ill understand,negative
i thought the episodes i saw were bad we all do,negative
this is where the story really takes off you name it its in there i took one for a lot of people by watching this please dont see this movie,negative
no plot horrible acting theres plenty out there and they are a hell of a lot more entertaining than this crap,negative
im not sure which i hate more the script the background music or the story im done game over,negative
i dont know where to begin hands down the worst film ive ever seen,negative
surprised the hell out of me i can tell you that much why,negative
this is a film that had a lot to live down to,negative
i did not like this movie i cant believe i wasted my time on this one,negative
did i miss anything just do a better job next time like you did in two plus one,negative
now the script thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line that was more difficult but what about the effects you ask come on now people the rating that was easy the end,negative
okay what do we get as soon as were told one thing shes off doing the other the film never makes it clear one of her first lines is im not here,negative
its in one word boring i was very disappointed about jack black what about school of rock,negative
i love b movies as well all the elements to make a great horror film were there,negative
story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while,negative
and thats it and no thats all there is to that scene too,negative
in a word this film was boring a big problem is with the two leads he was boring and she was annoying,negative
the story is very predictable though expected and the humor is lame and the direction what do one expect,negative
i have seen bad but this was definitely the worst just bad,negative
the plot was weak to say the least at least i didnt pay to rent it,negative
and all the songs and music of the movie are all bad,negative
with that line starts one silly boring british sci fi film,negative
the acting wasnt that great but what really is obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogue effects and storyline,negative
the ending is one way to end the piece not the most original but at least it was over,negative
but its also an incredibly enjoyable one move without thinking,negative
the beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the special effects that this is a low budget movie this movie is simply here,negative
just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one,negative
mess of a movie the jokes are lame the kids dont know a thing though,negative
would that we could say the same about the writer director,negative
nothing new there that was done in the second movie the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy,negative
you do not care if the characters indeed even if the actors themselves live or die,negative
as i said sometimes low budget is good well this was that piece of crap,negative
the acting was ok story what story maybe thats the point its war after all but ive seen far better war films overall this is one of the worst films i have seen please dont waste your time and money on this,negative
the first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is most of the movie really doesnt make sense,negative
i dont mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take no gone no because it makes no sense none of this in the film either,negative
it is the actual worst movie i have ever seen you know what,negative
i will say though that it is almost bad enough to be funny why oh why did they do this,negative
youre never supposed to take this movie seriously i realize that but youre supposed to think its funny right unfortunately she is put to bad use here,negative
unfortunately its not much to look at either do as i say and not as i do,negative
what a shame this could have been good the main problems are the script and the star if they were giving it their best it is a sad case indeed,negative
is that really what film has become now to the film and why it is so bad ok so its a low budget movie but that should not change the story or writing why was he even in this movie that is what this film wanted to be blood that must mean its good right give me a break,negative
but for whatever reason there wasnt much there bill finally theres the story,negative
this movie was one of the greatest movies ever made it had everything to make a movie great oh wait i must be thinking of a good movie,negative
is it worth seeing i didnt wish for my two hours back but i dont know that id recommend it to others,negative
believe it or not this was at one time the worst movie i had ever seen since that time i have seen many more movies that are worse how is it possible,negative
it was actually pretty interesting hes all get the bad guys all the time we get the picture anyway interesting,negative
at all there are a couple of good scenes in kill me later which show what could have and should have been,negative
where is the suspense every body is talking about seen it many times at least mr the movie is not worth it,negative
i wasnt disappointed though it was just as awful if not worse than what i expected,negative
nothing and i mean nothing is believable in this movie and dont start about low budget because even with a low budget you could write a better script,negative
wrong it would be money better spent it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror thriller or whatever it is supposed to be probably both,negative
i can watch anything but this movie was so very boring worst thing i have seen in years,negative
probably its problem started with a weak script it has to be better it has to be,negative
whatever it was it was poorly done and not worth watching i dont watch movies for blood and gore but because this film had little else going for it it should have shown the actual killing more overall a waste of time,negative
i watched this from beginning to end and have no idea of what the story was or even if there was one it doesnt matter how scenes are shot because they dont add up to a story its easy to find something better because you wont find much worse,negative
not here though oh and the less said about the ending the better happy film viewing everyone,negative
this is one of those films that i could only sit through once the problem was in the script the dialog the direction the editing the sets and the special effects its such a great book,negative
when i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series i dont recommend it ever,negative
he says well we know one thing you get the idea,negative
however as we go along we realize dr when dr dr when or how did he get the car back dr now how would he know that he didnt see her do it as far as i know and she didnt tell him she did it how would he know that,negative
it might sound cool but believe me its not its about one of the very few good things about this movie he has some really cool lines though,negative
it also features some of the worst dialogue ive ever heard and i did awful,negative
apparently theres a very good reason why i never heard about dr so when dr why doesnt that ever happen to me see nothing dr dr dr,negative
this movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town,negative
now dont get me wrong and thats it there are some things you should simply not give in to even though they might look like a lot of fun at first,negative
because theres nothing else there to show not dead yet not dead yet,negative
for the first half of the movie there just doesnt seem to be much going on it feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leads just had to get together there are moments i really enjoyed you just dont see stuff like that every day,negative
unfortunately things dont always work out the way they should they do nothing to stand out,negative
funny and this film is not the fighting the idea of fighting is taken far too seriously,negative
perhaps it comes down to it being so old all of which happen here,negative
this story could have come out of every little kids head doesnt work do they yes one great acting and the rest,negative
where do i begin i wanted to enjoy this movie and i did hell what else is there to do when youre dead i had to ask myself it was a fun watch it was worth a good laugh,negative
this is just a very bad film one of the worst films that i have ever seen,negative
its not as bad as it sounds either way there was really no need for this movie what was there a need for,negative
or who say know the self involved white people in love me either,negative
as far as i knew the main character was new to this school but apparently not but wait a minute but as the story goes on he is very clearly out of his mind now the movie comes to a close that was the close what the hell was that are these people in the same situation end of the thing thats what i thought then that is pretty much what i still think now i highly doubt it,negative
i think this is probably one of the worst movies ive watched in a long time trying to get the same characters with different people is such a bad idea instead they get new actors that are horrible at what they did where do they get some of these people was this their first movie it sure seemed like it,negative
i like many of the actors here and they do a good job but overall i found this movie dull as im not a fan of the genre,negative
this one is bad not too much in this one,negative
this movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part the actors all did what they could,negative
and thats just the plot how then is he left,negative
what were they thinking you get the picture the scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens,negative
what makes this movie bad is not the acting but the premise behind it,negative
its the same feeling you may get after watching this,negative
well let me tell you this no and it just gets worse from there,negative
the acting is very poor and it doesnt really follow the first one its not the worst movie ive ever seen but its on the list they made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying,negative
at this point theres still nearly an hour to go can you guess what happens now its not very deep or difficult,negative
i am simply a fan of the films how is this good,negative
overall the movie was a little slow going but entertaining enough to watch the whole thing,negative
at least it was short so i didnt feel like i had wasted too much of my time dont get me started on the ending,negative
its getting worse the series is on a serious down fall check out the first three miss the next three then watch the last one,negative
it wasnt which however wasnt a problem for me the script is simply not good enough,negative
finally the movie itself is a drama thats it the two become friends,negative
i dont know where to begin its so bad its not even funny,negative
and with music no less then there is the music the problem with this movie is that she wont get out of her own way awful awful awful,negative
you have a good voice and i miss your musical side,negative
and i must say it was actually better then the first one a baby what it would be about,negative
what a horrible comedy totally lame the supposed humor was simple and stupid dont waste your time with this one,negative
there are lots of extremely good looking people in this movie thats probably the best thing about it perhaps that even makes it worth watching its unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through,negative
i didnt know a lot about it so i wasnt sure if it was going to be worth it,negative
there could have been maybe some mystery but there is not in my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life the special effects and sets were average too nothing special what so ever,negative
now i know why it was even worse than id expected it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things really a waste of time and money i must say that the plot line is awful,negative
are we supposed to feel sorry for the characters of hate them dont ask me,negative
oh thats boring stuff its even worse because the director is female,negative
i have to admit that by moments i had to laugh at how bad that movie was the worst acting i have ever seen from any of these people,negative
the acting was fine the direction was ok it was just the story that didnt work in my opinion,negative
not good rent or buy the original watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then maybe,negative
there are some bad movies out there most of them are rather fun the sound quality is something else as you cant understand a word most of the characters are saying if you dont believe me see it for yourself,negative
you have got to hear the part about why the wife did what she did in order to save her husband it absolutely killed the movie in some parts,negative
its not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre s i good for us horror fans i wont say how because that is part of the plot,negative
this for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick,negative
she really looks like her and is actually pretty good,negative
im serious think about it its for your own good,negative
so how bad can this be right well bad its that bad,negative
though im not sure what my problem was at such an early age but i was very much into the book despite such an interest i didnt actually see the film until several years later i should have left things as they were which of course makes it the most fun to watch,negative
the special effects are actually quite good and the gore is well done,negative
there are no love stories between people or a person and the city cant you find love in new york,negative
i dont know why this movie was made if i made a movie like this it would have been a short,negative
it doesnt matter no she is not this film is annoying it is not worth your time except for a laugh,negative
the storyline was okay there was nothing much to do for him in the movie what are we the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action crap crap,negative
a two or two and a half stars out of five,negative
because the movie ends right when for the first time hes just able to talk to his wife about what he went through,negative
ill admit that i liked the first one and was really looking forward to the sequel i was let down,negative
finally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going on or who this character is etc its just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort,negative
it has its moments it just isnt very good most of the time,negative
there is little action or suspense until late in the film,negative
other than that do not even waste your time with this film,negative
the thing i wanted to know throughout was to do what exactly you never find out what they want i cant think of any anyway over and over but it is all quite simple,negative
the acting is as bad as any movie ive ever seen the plot is terrible and predictable some movies are so bad theyre good believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them im really not sure what else to say here,negative
i think it is i think it isnt i think it does i think it doesnt but what the play the movie they are one and the same now does at this point is obviously not,negative
in film i feel as though it should be more than just art i think it should be more than that a way to tell a story on screen it is good film making but there really isnt anything else to it,negative
out of stars lets see no i know we dont need him,negative
the worst movie i have seen in quite a while,negative
there is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call good and the plot if anyone finds it im sure it would be as boring as everything else,negative
there is a reason for this id ask what were they thinking,negative
it was an all right movie its just kind of a boy meets girl movie but i guess thats why i didnt see it in the theater,negative
but then again what ever is man oh man i cannot think of anything else to say about this flick,negative
i just cant see it any other way how do we know its him,negative
oh how wrong i was the film doesnt even work on a so bad its good level,negative
very very sad that it has come to this dont waste your time,negative
so my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it,negative
even the worst ive seen at least had a soundtrack,negative
the director does not know what to do with a camera the happy ending well it looks like that there must be one so the story is sad but not too sad the idea is the only thing that is great,negative
what on earth was that my kids could do better movies with our video camera but maybe we just did not get the point of the movie,negative
isnt it romantic the movie overall is bad enough to be funny and thats about the best thing i can say for it,negative
im sure a lot of guys will love this movie,negative
i recommend you to buy this game and the first game too isnt as good as this game still fun though,negative
i mean the writers dont have one so i would expect you to you know it,negative
yes bad acting isnt only one thing to mention bad script not so bad music unfortunately stupid they are so happy on the island they are going to die and they are happy love just stupid,negative
okay thats maybe going too far but not by much,negative
im so sorry but i have to tell this film was the most terrible i have ever seen before everything might be known forward i dont understand how might you let make it im so sorry but i have to tell this film was the most terrible i have ever seen before everything might be known forward i dont understand how might you let make it,negative
what they did add was enough to make your i at least i think it was god,negative
this movie is the worst ive seen this movie has nothing i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth great actors but bad script,negative
it is not much and it certainly is not obvious,negative
this is a must see first of all to see the work out,negative
the plot is awful the comedy is awful save your time,negative
i have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life what a joke that would have been nothing on the show was even close to the real world no wonder it didnt stay around on tv,negative
all true enough but the reality was so much better etc etc etc,negative
come on bad script ten lines its not ok if your comment is less than ten lines,negative
but that being said i didnt find this film to be completely terrible i enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times,negative
and the fact that its not the original to recommend it,negative
you light up my life now maybe something interesting will happen and something interesting did happen but dont waste your time or money on this flick,negative
comes rest stop this is where our interest is lost but no but wait excellent you know if anything youll learn how not to make a movie,negative
some are great really some are good and some are bad i couldnt believe it then it really gets stupid,negative
in fact the director has written here at imdb a,negative
i am a big movie fan i will never get those hours back,negative
what the hell is the story in this movie where to start okay this is not a how stupid can you be cut to the action if youre going for a b flick movie please,negative
his version didnt work but he might have been right,negative
i wish the whole film had been better though he should have gone out with something better,negative
but is that enough not a chance best guess this one isnt if its not even good for that what the hell is it good for,negative
what a waste of effort poor effort by writer and director,negative
dont expect much from this film like i said do not expect much from this film it was done on a cheap budget,negative
but man was his first attempt ever bad there are people playing more than one role and there are a few interesting shots around there but really this is a mess,negative
its just a horror film after all how awful does everyone just buy this stuff,negative
the first episode no less this show was so horrible what can i say,negative
i just watched this movie the story is bad the acting is if possible even worse the movie has one or two nice moments but thats it and having those two small good moments doesnt make up for anything in between before or after those moments,negative
the party itself is full of people you would never want to know but its pretty dull viewing,negative
hes one of if not the best actors of this genre he made me laugh if anything he did rather well he was probably the most believable out of the entire cast in my opinion wouldnt surprise me im extremely disappointed that this movie wasnt taken seriously thats the part everyone wants to see then again this is all just my opinion i cant tell you how to waste your money,negative
i will never see another movie with him in it directing it etc etc save your money on this one shame on you mr,negative
but it is so much fun to watch everything about it is hilarious it sounds truly awful but i enjoy it every time i watch it,negative
again this is a movie with one voice unless hes just doing it for the money,negative
but of course it never does maybe they would learn something,negative
this is a very very very bad movie the dramatic scenes are a joke again this is terrible very very very terrible,negative
thats it was that worth a movie i knew it wasnt supposed to be a great movie but i was at least expecting one,negative
i believe she is given poor lines the movie was not that terrible which brings me to another point well lets talk about something else do you even have to guess dont ask now no worst moving on i know it sounds like maybe i should have given the movie a one based on my comments this movie has a lot of bad but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place,negative
i love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years,negative
its a shame because they did have some good actors in this movie,negative
some films are so bad that theyre good this is clearly not one of them it was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home,negative
the first two bring it on movies were both quite good in their own ways not,negative
okay fine thats about it i am thinking that it was probably the first have at it here you go the movie was stupid and you will never get those minutes of your life back,negative
where should i start from the plot the direction the acting,negative
which wouldnt have been so bad believe me the ending you come up with will look far better than how this film actually ends,negative
it doesnt oh must i go on anything would be better it would be better than this,negative
i am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies i have ever seen,negative
while the thing that couldnt die isnt what i would call a good movie it does have a few things going for it you would think that this was a one and done type of movie for most of those involved shes horrible whats that about,negative
i hate a movie that doesnt have an ending then it ends,negative
this has to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life,negative
i just watched this movie horrible acting horrible direction horrible cinematography and all this by a hollywood director,negative
i saw several good french movies but this one i dont like,negative
very slow indeed the cinematography is not excellent but not the worst either the sounds are ok ive seen worse believe me but this is just waste of time and i dont get the good reviews here,negative
they were actually given money for this crap isnt that amazing please come on who gives money for such crap movies,negative
this show is awful this show is terrible its not even that big,negative
i couldnt sit through the whole thing i mean what was that all about the quality both picture and sound are terrible the acting,negative
this movie has got to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst one ive ever seen it wasnt even a bad b movie the special effects were ridiculous i didnt last long,negative
this film is terrible a new low even for him the plot is terrible dont watch it,negative
seriously i mean very seriously when i first started watching the show i thought it was good the storyline were either too boring or predictable dont know how these shows get to play for so long,negative
it was quite an experience did they even see the video,negative
where to begin on this movie the acting in this movie was average the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasnt special i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director,negative
but this was one of the most awful movies ive ever seen bad acting bad screenplay bad everything this is my personal opinion,negative
i hope the people who made this movies read these comments,negative
absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame,negative
so i watched the movie a masterpiece of animation unfortunately the story doesnt keep up,negative
you never knew what was going on someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies again also was this supposed to be a horror film because it was a lot more funny than scary,negative
help who is this movie for why do they keep making them but why should we go,negative
this movie is not funny the cast is bad the film is bad it is not funny,negative
this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen shes awful,negative
two years before the fact nice going in fact you could probably make up better yourself after watching these whats good about it thats about it three stars not a killer comedy but it tries,negative
this was just horrible the plot was just ok but the rest of the was was bad,negative
sometimes a film comes along that is unique definitely one to avoid,negative
even though this came first i just didnt find it that enjoyable,negative
but everything in this movie is bad its a really bad film that you have to stay away from,negative
but unfortunately for all involved thats not the case turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didnt even have any money good thing i didnt rent the movie myself,negative
i guess these people dont watch a lot of t s,negative
good not much acting is called for and not much is given its just that there are so many better films of the genre out there,negative
its not bad as such its just you really dont care i mean i really didnt care at all this is one to avoid,negative
theres really not a whole lot to say about this its just really really bad,negative
not to mention that if they were going to make it into a horror movie this was poorly acted,negative
another sad thing about this show is that you know whats going to happen the moment you see the opening credits been there done that even the actors look like they were forced into doing this movie,negative
wait wait wait wait wait wait what this movie is terrible absolutely terrible it fails this movie fails,negative
the sequences are to the point and very entertaining all in all this is a pretty poor film,negative
this is not really clear they go to the worst doctor ever,negative
not that much editing is just awful none of which were funny weird,negative
we get no real history we get instead a hollywood version of history why the love of a good woman of course surprise he gets it good simple ones how anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me they dont avoid,negative
it is like a stand up comic whos not getting laughs but cant leave the stage in the end you dont want to laugh you just want to turn away,negative
man where do i start so what do we do now,negative
as far as the story goes first story acting third ok music would have been worse without it but apart from that ok i guess,negative
i understand you think the subject is interesting and thats ok not everyone is pretty put a little effort into it if youre going to do this for a living,negative
the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale this is the classic,negative
other than that i really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture if you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film this is your movie enjoy the picture,negative
i never seemed to be able to figure that one out,negative
acting was awful as for me ill never get those two and a half hours back,negative
this film took itself way too seriously and just didnt know when to end,negative
it looks like they spent more time effort and money making the dvd cover than they did on the actual movie this is so not worth the money or the time,negative
if you like that stuff then this film isnt that bad really,negative
how could it possibly have gone so wrong at all,negative
they must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film shame,negative
this film is without a doubt the worst action film i have ever seen,negative
this is crap next we come to the acting which is simply horrible she is so scary looking i wanted to look away when she was on screen nice this movie is just horrible from the start,negative
what could possibly be wrong with it well not everything,negative
sure its a good book older kids will have no interest it,negative
well i can and will be very short the script seems to not know which way to go its a bit silly,negative
nothing happens then the end never comes because theres no beginning and no middle theres nothing,negative
here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea that is the problem isnt i mean what is that,negative
then i saw it now i know dont get me started about the cast and as far as the end goes two stars,negative
oh my word this is the worst film i have ever seen,negative
it needs to pay some more one of the worse movies ever stay away,negative
an i that most mean you have an i all and all its a ok movie if s dont comment on a movie if you dont know anything about movies but i guess an i,negative
to put it simply its just terrible a wasted budget and terrible writers well first off lets talk about this from a personal level very very poor effort it even fails on that level as well thats all the show is at this point,negative
went to watch this movie expecting a nothing really much action flick still got very disappointed well nothing of that sort happens wonder what was the director thinking a perfect way to waste your time and money definitely not for people who have a little movie sense left in them,negative
just because your beautiful doesnt make you a movie star where is she now,negative
s i got a few good laughs out of it at first,negative
well they didnt no you cant its not even annoying why no but it looks good if she just wanted to kill herself guess what it it doesnt look good at all why is that so well thats another story and now it was coming after me and so on i mean it is it it makes no sense this could be fun but since whole movie is dead serious it isnt and the mystery its predictable and easy to guess,negative
we couldnt believe how stupid it was well i guess the joke is on us and boy are they right what dont waste your time or money on this one youll be completely disappointed,negative
it really is a work of art to see every time,negative
there is a note from a mr nothing happens having seen the box i know exactly how he feels,negative
he is a good character actor but thats about it,negative
all i can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny,negative
from the annoying characters in this movie and on and on the acting is great but the writing is horrible,negative
i have tried to like this show i really have but i cant find a reason why anyone would like it shes always perfect and no one is like that in real life all the shows fans are just young girls who dont know any better,negative
i couldnt even sit through the whole movie it was pretty hilarious,negative
i tried to enjoy this i really did just please dont watch this movie,negative
the performances were horrible the soundtrack is not memorable either,negative
pretty much what everyone else on here said is dead on yes it was bad but that was to be expected the main problem i had with this movie is that it was just basically boring,negative
there is not much of a plot if any i do not understand the high rating for this film,negative
i expected more from her rent the movie and youll know what i mean ill admit it,negative
i will never look at them the same again everyone knows they never could act,negative
when i saw who the cast was i couldnt believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie memorable,negative
i was surprised by their performance expected more since theyre good actors thought it was a slow beginning but it got worse when is supposed to be a mystery movie for real what happened boring,negative
i find that the plot and idea are very good many of the supporting actors were very good who does she know i would very much like to see this film re made with some talent,negative
believe me i am not such a person where they there too it just seemed so out of place and wrong that may be okay to make a point but it didnt seem to be used that way here and i certainly dont like like it when others do but again this didnt seem to be the case here it just seemed so out of place at times it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her i know i was,negative
its just not funny why would anyone laugh hes not funny,negative
then this is your show or something the end awful,negative
the original was bad enough the sequel was even worse,negative
this was obviously the worst movie ever made dont waste your time or money on this one its extremely cheesy and horrible,negative
this movie is incredibly funny and stupid but never mind that it is very entertaining in this film you dont need to pay attention to anything the acting is the same lame what can i say dont rent it watch it on tv with friends it is much more entertaining,negative
so where do i begin the acting is beyond awful its like you are watching a high school play being filmed,negative
now i know why there are bad movies in the world this one however was one of the worst,negative
romance can be done well and when it is the viewer is left feeling the love portrayed on screen its about the same,negative
i thought it was poorly made just because of the whole story line lame i cant believe someone actually gave this movie a ten but i guess there are people that like this movie dont waste your money on seeing this movie believe me,negative
the acting was at times good but more times bad the most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend ok it is a good idea but thats all this movie had or if you have absolutely nothing better to do,negative
at last with the same guy one has to wonder,negative
there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list i cant really recommend the film,negative
i think that this is one of my top ten worst movies i have ever seen dont watch this movie dont waste your time,negative
dr overall doctor gore is a film that certainly isnt for everyone as a matter of fact it is total crap,negative
my wife and i never got into the movie she wanted it off i said its going to get better i love to watch a movie to feel good not sad at the end i know they dont make many good movies now days i think action movies are the only ones to watch,negative
there wasnt any of that here i wouldnt recommend this movie at all especially if you were a fan of the tv series,negative
as i said i am not a fan of this team,negative
even at night then he takes off by himself and gets shot by that old man,negative
im not saying all these shows are bad but they arent good either but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this now okay,negative
i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it its awful,negative
i myself felt this gave the film a different feel many parts were seen before in the tv series now if you saw the movie first rather than the series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan,negative
it doesnt even have any style to it and given its director one would expect that even if it had nothing else it would have that,negative
as i see many people say that this is like a tv movie not exactly the movie was not fun even one second to me so i could not get over for a while,negative
there are bad movies then there are the movies that are so bad that they become almost art this is one of those films,negative
i would not recommend it if you have something better to do,negative
definitely not a movie you would want to go with your family,negative
but hes alone i kept watching in hope that it would get better it didnt,negative
pretty good for straight to video i think not more time could have and should have been spent on the script,negative
mr i sit through crap so you dont have to what do you think this is about oh well guess it didnt quite work out,negative
first off this is the worst movie ive ever seen that may make you want to see it but it is not bad in a good way,negative
why not just make a documentary the music of course is another story,negative
but all of these made sense that could work as a surprise but it didnt surprise me it does not work in a movie like this the end felt much like an open end i expected a whole lot more of it i liked watching it most of the time it is just not such a special movie it is a shame that they did not,negative
there is nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone even the bad guy isnt really bad thats it what will she do she is not happy,negative
i think that saying this film has too many is not what makes this film bad,negative
the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story i dont,negative
but i cant recommend this film i know im being too kind to it out of four,negative
this movie has an interesting enough story but it plays out very bad here,negative
okay i thought to myself im not sure what the point of this movie was and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with,negative
well it didnt there was hope for something good here its too obvious too predictable,negative
this movie was strange it was really weird one of a kind,negative
bad things happen you sit and watch it you dont care so what i hope they had a great time making this movie,negative
then it looks good again and we dont have a moments doubt about whos who okay,negative
i have seen some truly bad movies boring movies and even low budget movies it is really really really boring the whole movie is about trying to figure out what is going on that is it the dialog oh the dialog why not this movie has none of that it is so bad that if my name was dr,negative
i have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny but its not some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad but this is not one of them,negative
theres plenty of gore to be had here there has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting nothing that happens here is interesting here we get yet another one for no real reason,negative
it was one of those late night its there i saw it things sometimes they are great the movie had a really good cast it had good special effects,negative
to give me a present god its awful this isnt one of them it is simply bad,negative
however this was one of the worst i have seen i couldnt imagine what mr that brings us to mr,negative
but no they should have just left then dead they did not leave the last bit it did not make any sense,negative
many kids movies have some big point theyre trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message this one doesnt have any message at all the acting is pretty bad the movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review need i say more with all that said kids will love it if you dont mind your kid seeing movies about kids fighting this is a good movie to let them see i say kids because i think even the girls will like it no no no never,negative
if youve seen other movies like this theyre probably better whats bad is everything else why are you so stupid look out this one does not,negative
this is a joke right this cant be a real film its not even a real video right comedy so much for romance in every way,negative
this film has to be one of the most boring films ever made,negative
i dont understand why i decided to see this movie as it was a waste of my life the acting is among the worst ive ever seen as is the writing the characters are all stupid and there is not one funny scene in the entire movie dont rent it dont watch it dont even say that it looks interesting its bad enough i saw it,negative
can someone please make a decent movie out of this to show how it is done,negative
overall a boring film and a general waste of the actors talent sorry i wouldnt recommend it,negative
one day i thought to myself what is the worst possible thing that could happen today well what is there to say there is one funny line that i can remember and the acting is far worse than the first one,negative
unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it i am disappointed by the film,negative
this movie is bad as we all knew it would be but this movie is just to slow not that hes anything worth watching now youll enjoy them much more,negative
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
doesnt mean this movie is good i have to care about a character though and there just wasnt much here to care about i ask for very little got less,negative
in part because i usually give every movie an even break and because i thought that a single movie couldnt be that bad they all had a none of the above avoid this movie anyway you can,negative
but this was easily the worst movie ive ever seen kids or no kids it was a when it this stupid thing going to end kind of experience,negative
this film is bad not so bad it is good just bad,negative
why the acting is pretty bad too the serious parts become comedy,negative
even then i couldnt remember where i got up to which left me watching it from the beginning again,negative
bad film fans like me who are a crazy bunch will probably love it all others,negative
i dont know if this has ever been shown on tv if it has i dont know why if you ever get a chance to see it do something else anything your time will have been better spent this has been my first movie review it might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and i wouldnt make book that will happen bill,negative
the main problem is that the movie doesnt have a good story to begin with,negative
just a dumb old movie she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way,negative
there is so much wrong with this movie its sad bad editing bad acting its got it all for real where was it spent,negative
even if i had expected it to be bad i would have been disappointed where to start i get it third the movie takes itself seriously if youre going to have a crap horror movie make with the killing,negative
i thought this movie was awful all in all i thought it was really just a bad movie,negative
the problems are many a isnt that what the movies supposed to be about one would think so,negative
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot is awful and the acting is worse and if for some reason that you do want to see this movie dont watch it with your parents,negative
i expected a bad movie and got a bad movie so you have understand how bad this movie is does it have some good parts too bad she doesnt take her top off the lead actors arent bad either dont watch it it isnt worth it,negative
no basically your watching something that doesnt make sense dont waste your time i really hope nothing like this is made again,negative
it fails as a comedy as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie,negative
i couldnt care less about anyone in this movie this was supposed to be a comedy there were characters that you could have liked but you didnt what is there an inside joke there,negative
okay who was it there were so many of you before i say anything else ill say this just because you dont understand a film doesnt mean that its not great but and this is a very very big but really please dont you just dont understand that means the story doesnt go in a straight line just maybe youre right well they dont make sense and they never let you back in ever you dont care about anything you dont understand anything you go home hes great but i cant recommend you see the film just to see him hes only in it for a few minutes please believe me its horrible,negative
this is without question one of the worst movies i have ever seen however i dont think the film isnt worth seeing,negative
anyone i didnt think so oh wait id like back the time this movie took out of my life please,negative
full house is one of the worst tv series ever why who in the world could think that full house is entertaining and funny not even one episode as a try out avoid this series this is the worst television show ever do not watch this,negative
but my girlfriend and i decided to check it out the death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good but other than that it was just stupid,negative
what else would i expect now they were truly scary i guess were not supposed to ask,negative
whatever no seriously never hes the one who gets killed in the first five minutes please,negative
i got none of that i dont think its really worth the time it takes to watch it though,negative
its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually i just lost interest,negative
i loved the first season third season was fairly novel and original and was ok and then comes the end well okay i,negative
theres nothing here and obviously here that doesnt work i cant stand the male leads,negative
do you like stand up then stay away from this maybe an idea,negative
how can that be funny and why it that my guess is that its because he should now better,negative
but they did so its not there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film other than how terrible the soundtrack is,negative
terrible terrible terrible terrible did i mention terrible you can tell just by the dvd cover not to get this movie but unfortunately that wasnt the case for me its beyond horrible quite possibly the worst film ever,negative
this one really bit the big one for me its that simple,negative
the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again,negative
i thought maybe maybe this could be good i thought wrong,negative
this would be the worst film id ever seen awful truly awful so here are the worst points the dialogue and finally and finally why just why,negative
but its supposed to be modern art which is about the art itself so can i recommend this,negative
wasnt fan of it when i first saw it and after another viewing im still not one,negative
at least his son made a decent soundtrack it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films,negative
so big the suspense was over from there nothing made sense,negative
i love movies in this genre so why didnt i like this movie i do not recommend this movie,negative
i dont think one can even call this a b movie it really really appears to be done for comic effect although i know it wasnt is there anything good about this movie it was low budget low talent low everything,negative
i have just seen today you die it is bad almost very bad pretty bad no stupid they should have kept it simple and it would have worked you can tell because they only film him from behind and never show his face this was good i liked it but it could have been so much better,negative
sounds cool right probably the worst film ive ever seen ever ive seen a lot of very very bad movies possibly his house what no but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find sound good to you or if youre a human and want to learn the same,negative
its terrible i remember watching it when it first came out,negative
although the actors all did a good job the movie was terrible and im sure i will not watch any others made by this sorry team,negative
this film is terrible the bad things are everything else about it i know exactly what id do in their situation,negative
need we say more he is the main reason you should see this film,negative
i have seen some really bad movies in my time but never one as bad as this,negative
as i said most of the movie was fairly good not a bad plot line but if nothing better is on id give it a try,negative
terrible just terrible probably the worst film i have ever seen etc etc,negative
im still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film,negative
she doesnt know lets go both ways youve seen all of this before and better done at that anything,negative
what this movie doesnt have is any drama really sometimes you dont know its coming and dont have enough time to look away,negative
this film has an interesting plot but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor i was very disappointed,negative
now i think i know what people are going to say how do you know how bad it is have you ever watched it there is a talking dog why that isnt comedy thats stupid comedy i know what some people are thinking,negative
i was expecting a lot more of this film than what i actually got the only thing the movie had going for it was that it wasnt particularly boring,negative
it was dumb there were a few funny parts but not that funny i liked some of the actors in it though night live people in the movie but i wouldnt recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on,negative
dont waste your time on this film now theres an ending,negative
it is but not in that way just say no to this movie though,negative
ive never seen him act ive seen him in lots of films but ive never seen him act,negative
im not sure the way he was killed would really have worked interesting,negative
then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool,negative
pretty silly and then theres the couple that has to have sex shes a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress,negative
i think that says a great deal no talk about writers directors actors i am not surprised this thing went straight to video dvd,negative
i knew it would be low budget yet i must admit i could not look away this film is a good case for an excellent story that was told wrong it is well worth the money who knows,negative
it is a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie how do you rate it this is not where it ends every thing she says is funny the whole dialogue actually gave me quite some laughs may be a good thing because basically it is just another laugh for the modern audience,negative
but this is very poor no i dont think so there is not a laugh to be had thats the best they can do see it only if youre a die hard fan of the original its the only way youll find any kind of laughs in it,negative
reality check time here is his version of the film,negative
isnt life difficult enough for the average person s dont get me started on game shows is there anyone out there that feels similar,negative
well i soon found out my god this film was awful how did this happen,negative
okay so far so good i give this episode two,negative
its not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone doesnt want her in the house can you say dull i wont even go into the script the actors are given to work with,negative
there was no real plot or if you do see it dont expect much seriously,negative
keep in mind that mr king had nothing to do with this film,negative
i hate this movie i hate the acting dialog setting writing and directing,negative
that being said it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level so bad it is almost good its fun,negative
to use the story but change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog apparently it does but to me it seems completely out of place seems completely out of place,negative
however the script the direction and some scenes were just awful,negative
just not believable in the role no one else was at all memorable long time ago not great but ok and im a sci fi fan cant recommend this one,negative
hes never gone back then we cut to the present where the films style takes over the plot is very simple i think i kid you not absolutely nothing happens in the entire film okay a few things do happen what do they do nothing i kid you not thats what happens they all just up and forget about it im not saying its the only violence gore or murder we see its not,negative
it simply would not have happened its not the acting or the direction thats poor,negative
i really tried to like saw the story may have been original but the direction sure wasnt what really did it in for me was the ending to me it just didnt make sense some of the better horror films are made for a reason where there is a reason for the violence we see in the story,negative
that said this movie was pretty bad its just a mess dont waste your time unless you really really like the actors because the story isnt very interesting,negative
except its all a dream or is it this is just well silly,negative
the ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie,negative
i just dont get it and the best part now thats entertainment,negative
dr this is obviously a pretty stupid movie the whole cast takes everything dead serious and actually arent too bad as actors,negative
this might have been an excellent flick however as many other people think so do i if the entire movie must be read then it kind of takes away from the movie and becomes something else but once i did it was a real let down so i guess we will never know how good the movie actually was,negative
not as funny as it should be not as deep as it wants to be outside of the sci fi movie its just a mess what,negative
i dont think so and dont start me on the ending god help us all indeed,negative
this film should have been much better than it was not much of a twist and not that interesting either,negative
i was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the over all score sorry but to rate this highly as many have is a joke the credits sequence at the start was so annoying too,negative
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little i was very disappointed in the movie there are some characters and scenes that seem scary for little children for whom this movie was made,negative
not just because of that theme in the movie no but it wasnt funny i dont see that message,negative
well he is in the film the one with the little kid in it you know the one what a shame youve all been had well right back at you i didnt actually pay to see this movie now thats a plot twist,negative
this is truly one of the most awful movies of all time how scary is that i kid you not,negative
ive seen a lot of movies in fact im not even going to write a lot it all ends happy too bad this movie is horrible this basically is not,negative
very little is said it looks good is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film hero with his girl its about four hours all my attempts to see this ill never get back,negative
what did they come for this was not a great movie and i could go on but i wont,negative
i get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie not all people but a lot of them because they dont want to admit they dont understand it everyone has a bad day come on isnt it great its so weird and crazy its just not cool,negative
oh she does right but of course its doesnt really matter i mean its only a t,negative
to those of you who gave this movie top score,negative
well we got it home and could not believe what we saw the main character is all over the place this is for you,negative
who knows why such things get made what else can a say,negative
god was behind everything what has god got to do with sci fi would this be a good ending,negative
and what exactly do those scenes in the credits have to do with the movie,negative
the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands directing and acting were awful out of,negative
it all goes wrong the police are outside and he keeps all the violence off screen really oh brother but the movie feels like too much of what it really is i dont mean that the wrong actors were cast sometimes it works its just not worth going out of your way to see maybe its true,negative
why because he plays rock music because its rock music through rock music okay so lets face it the rest of them are all rock stars,negative
the star the story the unique idea obviously not she went on to make more bad films and more bad films sad,negative
if so then mr i knew you could dont even waste your time,negative
how original apparently they did not and they were right,negative
im sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors whose talent is out of question,negative
stupid to say the least the director worked without a script and it shows,negative
sounds better than it actually turned out being but at least it was not boring,negative
how could you be a part of such an awful film but this one is something else,negative
although he seems to keep his heart on the right hand side of his body,negative
this was one of the shows that i wanted to follow up on,negative
theres nothing new here none of the actors are interesting here either,negative
however this movie is not the worst movie ever and so on,negative
sure some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way but none of the characters felt very real to me at all,negative
it started of good and was quite entertaining so why a bad review,negative
lets talk about the sound in this movie we hear sound when were not supposed to and so the film is crap i hope not and i think not,negative
people just dont care about a show within a show it doesnt even have to be with anyone,negative
unfortunately this is not one of those movies and when i say evil i mean evil,negative
this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time,negative
this movie has so many bad things about it i dont know where to start the acting is horrible the soundtrack was pretty bad the score is terrible,negative
but it didnt and thats where the films falls apart and he did so quite badly,negative
first of all the big twist towards the end was very predictable another problem i had is with the ending,negative
okay youll do kind of effort too late the lines and action are there think youll still like it i dont think so,negative
now ive seen it all it was not to be please,negative
what is wrong with american movies these days the men are no better in this movie guys act like girls girls act like guys,negative
oh and a good guy is killed too the big twist is that the cop here is a woman after all this is serious business,negative
ill start with the good but it doesnt stop there i dont think so so all in all i was a little disappointed,negative
and of course what would a movie be without sex,negative
may i say the role wasnt good it has a history of so many good films overall i was totally disappointed with the movie,negative
so yes do watch this movie as seen on that show and instead of giving this movie a single star out of ten stars you can give this a ten out of ten stars got that now,negative
as the movie goes on it gets a little more interesting but nothing brilliant,negative
this film is boring boring boring boring and boring its boring which most stand for god awful boring,negative
this movie is something horrible it is simply amazing how such bad movie can make it into the tv,negative
it looked awful well apparently i could tell a lot and most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly there are two good things about this film,negative
do not move lets there is one interesting moment in this film,negative
yet again im sure that there is a reason i,negative
everyone is so nice to each other you know lets give that a reality check my question is why isnt almost ever girl in that school all over him i know you can do better than that please,negative
we have to keep the characters and the time lines straight,negative
without doubt this is the worst movie ive ever seen poor acting poor script poor direction and poor production,negative
its not so kill off a main character and then bring him back as another actor,negative
take the money and make a movie even if it is crap,negative
this is probably the worst movie ive seen in a long time but this movie is very bad very bad maybe its the script maybe its the director probably a little of both probably a lot of both s,negative
i wish id taken the time to meet him while he was here sorry,negative
i dont know i dont know this is truly one of the worst movies ive ever seen,negative
the acting and direction was so bad this movie was turned into a comedy a second good point,negative
do not buy or rent this movie and thats not saying a lot for that movie either i was watching this movie and i wanted to kill myself during and after the movie,negative
so then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect,negative
this is one of the worst movies ever made predictable if i was in it or worked on it i would change my name,negative
well sorry to say but the same goes for the film,negative
theres a strange love story involved which doesnt have anything to do with anything she happens to look like his mother yes so what short film he is a guy that stuff happens to youve got to see the ending why but i do recommend it,negative
i didnt think he was much of a director then and still dont,negative
it is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen,negative
one word boring but that was then and now is now some movies do not get old well this is one of them,negative
oh how wrong they so often are maybe this show should to,negative
this movie had such a good premise to start with she was of course wrong,negative
do not see this movie this is a complete waste of time instead get the original,negative
this movie definitely made me laugh but that doesnt mean it was exactly funny well then again me and my friends had a lot of fun watching it not using it but the best part comes right at the end,negative
you have seen everything before but its well done but then,negative
please do not watch this movie if its the last thing you do,negative
this was an absolutely terrible movie both are great actors but this must simply be their worst role in history,negative
a perfect being makes for dull story telling what is the point of watching such a story,negative
oh and the worst lead up to a sex scene i think i have ever scene,negative
the daughter was a stand out performance stand out in the bad sense well at first one wait please dont watch it,negative
i didnt even watch this whole movie and another guy says sure take me back down even so its only average,negative
the result is crap the same goes for the characters we feel so bad inside and of not being who does this crap,negative
there just isnt enough here i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies it was not dont believe the few good reviews,negative
is this the movie well one thing is very clear so mr,negative
taking the audience out of the movie at every turn,negative
and made it seem like she had a big part in it not so she does what she can with the script but thats not much the sound was awful by that i mean things didnt go together kind of weird score was awful dialog really awful acting was awful i couldnt believe any of it they were really lame even then it was too long,negative
actually this has become one of my favorite b sci fi movies,negative
i thought i would like the movie a little but i didnt like it at all actually,negative
i dont even know where to begin lets run through the main points i keep trying to think of one that wasnt possibly the mother but thats it its the worst movie ive seen at the cinema for years if not ever,negative
i have not seen such a stupid dumb movie since quite a while i dont know what they were thinking when they made the movie not just that but it can also talk i bad,negative
even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made,negative
this straight to video cheap flick is based on a true story i dont doubt it not that id know this is my house get out they dont leave in other words get out it has a really cheap feel and bad acting,negative
this film without doubt is one of the worst i have seen it was so boring that i simply could not wait for it to end i do not on this earth know what anyone liked about it,negative
the girlfriend and i both love action films the music isnt good either everything about this movie is classic b style,negative
exactly what you would expect from a b movie but then i guess it wouldnt have been a b movie,negative
on the box its all there they work they meet girls they party end of story,negative
something has got to give whats there to do whats with the writing here this is supposed to be a comedy very little going on here,negative
why should anyone something that few films have done before in the past,negative
not here make of that what you will probably i was not wrong never did,negative
i tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then,negative
ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing,negative
a shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads,negative
whats he going to look like the other main problem was the ending as if to say there might be a sequel,negative
i said and indeed it was only a lot lot worse avoid it theres even nothing to laugh at,negative
so imagine how i was forced to watch it in complete or very bad too actually you dont,negative
okay so there arent really that many great movies around but boy i have no idea what these people thought they were doing i can just see it now please,negative
in one word why not it was a horrible start to my day i told you so,negative
this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through it was okay the ending it was okay,negative
the very best thing about it is that its short,negative
i though this film was okay lots of drama but not very much action until close to the end of the film the film itself is done okay the acting is decent but it just didnt do it for me in the long run at least thats what i think,negative
so what went wrong or maybe he was ill doesnt make it fun to watch but it is realistic,negative
the first third of the movie was very cool then they just couldnt keep it together the music was cool some of the writing was interesting early on classic dream sequence cop out ending if you ask me that could have made some interesting story,negative
how bad can you make a film the only feeling you get from the film is that its bad just bad it is but a waste of time,negative
yes the acting was great no this wasnt the typical hollywood film but the dialogue just wouldnt end or get interesting,negative
so the book may have been great but the movie isnt back to the movie i dont know,negative
this movie is absolutely terrible i know lets give mr good god i dont think we can oh wait i just had a terrible idea its terrible terrible,negative
this is possibly the worst of the worst there was no street light to be seen come on it felt like i was watching a middle school play please do not rent this movie,negative
just boring and not scary not even so bad its good,negative
a or how did we find this out b i,negative
i i dont know where to begin they dont know what theyre doing overall this movie this film this waste of film i should say is also a waste of time,negative
none of us liked it it felt a bit like a bad high school drama class attempt at film making,negative
this is not a good movie plus the acting from the lead roles i what was the director thinking,negative
if there is anything you should know about this film it is that wait i thought this was a zombie flick yes wonderful wait,negative
everything the audience was talking back to the screen so bad was the story again how many times,negative
i read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end however when i saw the movie i was very disappointed the movie let me down,negative
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is so is it a case of so bad it is good no wait havent we seen this before big deal how awful she is has she already made a decent film a time to kill okay,negative
ok ill admit it to end off this comment id like to tell you a little story,negative
well very small kids will think this is good night night,negative
the character really was dumb and that was all the dumb humor was all that had me watching the movie was ok and nothing else,negative
the writing was awful the acting was awful the subject was awful the actors looked like they were not really into the movie like they almost had to be there,negative
a wasted effort but maybe there are the special effects to watch,negative
oh no what to say about this film where does one start first lets start the with good okay thats about all for the good lets talk about the bad the ending didnt make sense not at all none,negative
this movie as bad as the first one if not worse,negative
the movie is not funny at all its just extremely predictable all the time,negative
and what did we get i was so disappointed by this episode this is absolutely the worst way to this series why couldnt it get a happy ending why did have a few of the main characters to die no how stupid what could have been worse,negative
t in fact she makes me feel sorry for poor mr the story is a mess,negative
but i love it it just works for me not here apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back,negative
it simply doesnt make sense i wouldnt really recommend his to anyone avoid if possible,negative
at what point does a film become so bad its good and the dialogue,negative
thats the only thing this movie has going for it of course this is the worst movie i have ever seen and ive seen some bad ones,negative
this is one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time its a little action thats it theres really no comedy and drama at all if you went to the cinema to see this i feel sorry for you i would not recommend it at all this is pretty much a action crime movie if you are not really interested in a good story or good acting then this might be for you,negative
the whole production from directing to the acting is poor was this movie shot in the dark the action is terrible and very badly done,negative
i have to admit that its been a while since i watched something this bad,negative
just what is the point of this film but it doesnt quite work that way but of course we never do avoid,negative
i saw this film in my cinema class well no not really was it a western kind of but no the writing wasnt terrible but it was just all over the place,negative
the film is very slow moving dont get me wrong i enjoy slow moving films,negative
it looked like it could be funny but i wasnt about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first the laughs never came no stars,negative
but it isnt i dont know if this is just the directors sense of humor but i just found it to be wrong just wrong the plot is stupid the acting is bad all of them but dont watch this you would have to experience it for yourself everyone else believe me,negative
the only thing great about the movie is its title,negative
both are good whats new the title song was really good the music overall was above average,negative
thats never happened before like all the jokes are the same and many are from the movie i do not think this is worth five minutes of your time much less a half hour,negative
this is the worst movie of all time if you actually watch the whole thing god help you,negative
or is it year after year you want good television or murder one,negative
its a film that isnt even good to look at this doesnt it is bad,negative
its certainly the worst movie ive ever had to sit through,negative
think about it for a minute how many more years,negative
she was like how did you know that thats how bad this movie is okay ill give it a chance run away far away,negative
i think it is very interesting this movie is called a thriller,negative
this should be my kind of movie lets go over why i decided to watch this in the first place completely how did that happen how the hell did that happen so lots of crap that could be entertaining but none of it is not the very worst thing youll see but a truly bad movie,negative
the storyline was very hard to follow it is not easy,negative
this is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if theyre supposed to be funny or not,negative
that may be reason enough to give it a try if you can find it,negative
none of it really makes sense the actors were fine i even liked the romance,negative
still i was surprised by just how bad it was first the story otherwise give this one a miss,negative
yes it does sound an awful lot like the plot of open water indeed,negative
i finally found a copy of this and watched it one night i dont remember the plot too well as its been quite some time since i watched it and i will not watch it again but well,negative
the animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film i give this movie a five just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed,negative
now seriously where should i start in this case it doesnt,negative
for all the acting talent in the film it just isnt interesting its just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him its not,negative
and what action there is to but the movie itself didnt do it for me in fact by the end of the movie they almost look better then in the beginning it really could have been better i think didnt enjoy this one to much,negative
the film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad,negative
so what was the point of this who knows give me a break,negative
weird stuff was it supposed to be funny what was it all about really,negative
i have to say its not very good the rest are so so we started watching it then turned it off then decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the film over all i would not recommend it,negative
that was crazy whats the deal with the change of police it is a completely different movie from,negative
but i still wanted to give it a try is this a comedy,negative
maybe ill mention those first because it will be over quickly next the storyline is well written so much for realistic fighting a much better job could have been done on that end,negative
when he wasnt on the screen the thing went dead maybe a very nice person but no actress,negative
the series does not start as it means to go on thats right,negative
really hell understand what youre saying that fact is not lost on dr dr,negative
is it a small town or a city what are these things does that make sense i could go on and on but i think you get the message,negative
i am sorry i have seen this awful film that should have never been made,negative
read the novel before or after and make up your own mind,negative
a bad one oh my i just wonder how low i you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy is there something than this is worth watching for,negative
i cant say much about this film overall well i think you get my point,negative
ive spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film give me a break,negative
the movie is done now you can go home if you ever saw the movies saw this one does not no its not but dont watch this movie if you expect great mystery or a real plot or even some kind of story,negative
ill not comment a lot whats to etc etc it has been a long time i havent seen a movie so bad,negative
not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good still the script is very bad,negative
this movie is some of the worst crap i have ever seen i can only figure that the actors really needed the money because this movie wasnt worth the film it was shot on,negative
what a shame that some good talent was wasted i felt quite let down not a good use of viewing time at least for me,negative
i am sorry but this movie is simply awful i still cant believe this film is completely awful all in all the worst short film i have ever seen,negative
bad acting bad writing this was a poorly written film,negative
there is no way you can watch this and enjoy the whole idea is not funny,negative
not so he must have seen something in her work that i didnt,negative
poorly acted poorly written and poorly directed special effects are cheap there is little suspense and even less action,negative
and when that finally comes its pretty all right not great not even good but pretty all right it was kind of boring so said we all,negative
the movie tells the story period guess he had a bad year back then,negative
in fact its a pretty poor film in general well it has been quite a while since the last film took place was i right in doing so well in some way yes it is so bad its almost not even funny,negative
and what do i find dont buy or watch it,negative
but there was actually no need for a second one i thought it was not very funny that just didnt work it was too much over the top and not too funny,negative
you wont miss anything the title alone is perfect well no,negative
this really is an okay series everyone in it is pretty good if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day,negative
now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that i couldnt stop watching,negative
yes a comedy true and true a joke thats ok,negative
and im not saying i know much more than anyone else but i do know or at least i think i know that most of the stuff in this wouldnt happen to how he killed people the cinematography was that of a five year old the acting i thought for the most part was pretty good really i did,negative
s sorry to the cast and crew if you are reading this i know that you worked hard to make this i know what goes into making a movie keep trying,negative
but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day good acting but i dont think that can save the movie,negative
i believe this because why else would they make this film it sure wasnt to make money,negative
i would like to say something different about this movie,negative
i seems though that every time one type of movie is released a second must be around the same time,negative
it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it,negative
a very poor script a very bad actors and a very bad movie say no more,negative
please i say this with all my heart do not even watch one episode of this show,negative
unfortunately that is not saying much the ending is particularly lame,negative
way too cool thats about it the only great character everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own,negative
i could never watch this movie alone i love it i thought the whole film was decent and interesting best horror film ever nothing can ever be this scary again,negative
its little wonder that this thing went straight to dvd i could say a little bit more about the plot but theres absolutely no need you already know over half this movie without ever seeing it,negative
no one can do what he does as well as he does director please come up with something original,negative
the jokes where really poor i was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all,negative
stupid it was over it is a b movie everyone,negative
the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review,negative
its a long time ago i saw this movie and still its one of the worst ive ever seen i didnt know it was such a crap if you like horror watch a real horror movie,negative
a lot what is this story a comedy did i mention theres also a kid in this film well forget about him,negative
what happened next you got it shots of the women working out not even the end of the movie can stop them,negative
there are so many great ones dont waste your time with this horrible movie,negative
i thought ok obviously i was wrong while watching this film but what were they thinking even these actors couldnt save this film at the end of the film i felt like this was a waste of money i didnt want to see it again sorry i can highly recommend it you me,negative
it is probably the worst movie i have ever seen,negative
we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made,negative
the police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer,negative
but this was a b western and not even a good one at that,negative
it is not very interesting to me i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act,negative
dont waste your time or money to rent or watch this movie,negative
the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film or was that the point,negative
if thats what its supposed to be it doesnt really work it just isnt that funny i have no idea what her character was about,negative
rent it to save money none of it is realistic whats up with that so what does he do oh well finally the movie was very dark not just in plot but so much happens at night it was difficult to make out what was going on rent it,negative
as for the acting it isnt all that bad the plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more entertaining,negative
it wasnt a bad movie but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy that is if you have nothing better to do,negative
period they should have been beautiful i really dont understand why it was such a hit as a book although i have to admit its one i havent read as yet usually i read the book and give the film a miss,negative
i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read but then nothing so what,negative
the acting in the movie is very poor for the most part dont get me started on that awful song played at the beginning unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up or should it be down to the so bad its good level,negative
its funny its left out of his a life in film documentary,negative
this movie is by far one of the worst b movies i have ever seen though the acting is decent the storyline is terrible,negative
it tries so hard to be hollywood but even hollywood stories have an okay story sometimes money wasted on an effort to be hollywood waste of almost a half hour of any viewers time,negative
i could have taken rest rather then watching this movie why cant they sit at home and spent their time at home,negative
i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy all they are supposed to do is make you laugh thats all,negative
if that makes sense or ever heard of the word zombie,negative
this movie was so poorly acted the script was lame okay ill get into the car with you why not i did not see the original it would be hard to make myself after seeing this movie,negative
the twist at the ending has been done before but it was something that wasnt completely expected,negative
but what i did see was so bad i thought no everything was poor about this film but no reality couldnt guess the end it was annoying as someone else said of course that would have happened not,negative
as much as i like japanese movies this one didnt just cut it all in all if your looking for an action japanese movie this isnt it in a bad way,negative
there are some good performances though and a lot of great atmosphere,negative
perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction but i didnt feel for anyone in this movie and without this feeling a movie doesnt work for me,negative
boring is the main word that comes to mind the bad effects and script arent enough to make you watch it,negative
man was this hard to watch the acting was horrible it was not well made at all thats stupid like this movie,negative
this movie has to be the worst film i have seen but i guess they also had the money for it,negative
others maybe a couple thats it makes you forget what a terrible movie youre watching almost two stars,negative
they are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny,negative
all in all i like the movie at first but now it is really annoying,negative
people dont act like this people dont talk like this really,negative
then again what do i know im just a child,negative
the story is different and the actors are different and its not funny,negative
is this supposed to be sci fi or comedy or what this is not movie making,negative
they should pay you to watch it not you pay them,negative
also all of it is filmed too close up then finally comes part two deep how is it beautiful i wanted to like this movie but this movie is dumb and dull,negative
but why cant you stay true to the book why must you change the way characters think and act,negative
the sad truth is much as i wanted to like this movie its well made it doesnt,negative
however we all know thats not saying much now would i say that hes a good actor i hope you will,negative
well not really the acting is very in any case this only makes the movie experience worse but theres really not much to say thats how i look at this movie anyway this movie had its moments its just a shame there were not that many but that doesnt mean i would not recommend it,negative
great cast it only gets worse after that or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable,negative
it has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and i didnt want to stay to see the horrible ending,negative
not much actually happens in this movie as for what is with the lead character,negative
her script isnt so bad its just bad directed in fact if the direction had been better and if better actors had been cast this could have been a really good film,negative
and i cant remember not a good thing but im sure they have to go back for something someone sorry,negative
i mean there are also some other bad things about it but i just dont have time for this,negative
the movie was so predictable why was he evil and killing his family scary music scary music scary music and,negative
i couldnt wait to see this the worst episode so far,negative
ok just what the hell is all this supposed to mean what a mess this isnt a really bad film as some have said bad move guys show me dr oh brother,negative
extremely slow movie the story is extremely weak in its characters,negative
s how can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters,negative
read the book and dont waste your time with this film,negative
he said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous,negative
i enjoyed parts of this movie i truly did and once you get to the end of it youll actually figure out whats truly going on,negative
the main problems are with the direction cheap budget and poor script,negative
maybe i was to young when i saw it i dont get this one though awful,negative
they should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way this is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie i do not recommend this movie,negative
i think it was their wrong turn thats why i give it two stars,negative
s in this case the writers out did themselves why oh why did screen writers have to mess up a good story,negative
unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie looked a lot more entertaining than this,negative
but not this one i always wanted to know what happened next this movie is not worth the time,negative
i will not tell you anything about the story for the simple reason there is no story well in the present where we live everything must happen fast thats really a shame,negative
the premise to make this documentary was excellent it is a big no,negative
this thing was just a complete mess from the get go the end i saw it for free and wanted my money back,negative
horrible the jokes are lame as and the plot is ridiculous and none of then are when shows are doing well make sense,negative
i love this movie but thats ok what a movie if you find a copy buy it,negative
too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste,negative
and thats what makes it the worst of all bad movies,negative
but i cant even think he has played in that movie the story is nearly nothing the special effects are very bad and the actors also,negative
i should know better theres plenty of them out there,negative
please but the the third one has no point do you hear it does anyone even mention it no its ridiculous kill it off where did it come from wrong wait for it,negative
it was just a terrible movie no one should waste their time go see something else this movie is without a doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life if you want to see a good movie dont see made men,negative
actor play is very poor waste of time and money,negative
predictable not entertaining at all wasted movie but it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start no great suspense no great direction low rating,negative
actually do not see this movie period please at least not seriously read a book,negative
this film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot another girl where exactly were they the acting is terrible i think but its hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it i would not recommend it it wasnt quite bad enough to be funny,negative
i will say that at least the movie makes sense but its bad and the music and everything real life has never been like this movie,negative
i dont get it i just dont get it add b then you get the children what are they doing there in the first place,negative
have some money than there is the script unique does it does it really the directing is well ive got nothing,negative
this movie tries to be more than it is first of all the acting is horrible the plot is quite interesting,negative
so bad its good the rest of the show is just so bad its bad,negative
but i must say that i find it bit hard to recommend this title,negative
the film is totally predictable from beginning to end its so silly the best thing i could say about this film is the cinematography which i actually liked,negative
its free so it cant be much good the story is very weak it is also very very long for what it is not funny and very not good even for free,negative
please give up your day job it cant be that all the actors are really this bad okay and in the end in the end he becomes evil why in fact,negative
i think any way never mind i dont want to know,negative
why the characters are not fun to watch and whats worse theyre not funny,negative
with blood blood and more blood it not a bad film but it not that good either,negative
this movie cant make up its mind what it wants to be and ends up being not much of anything come off it,negative
not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting,negative
any humor is not of the funny kind this should have happened to this script,negative
i saw this film a year ago its so far away from the reality its scary please love story i mean today we live in a time of a free will as never before,negative
this is absolutely beyond question the worst movie i have ever seen i cannot say enough bad things about this movie thats as far as i can go,negative
and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film,negative
the cover for this movie makes it look really cool yet i still expected a bad movie to come out of it just shows you how low theyre going to get as much attention as possible for the movie,negative
its well directed fairly well written and for the most part well acted,negative
but they are few and far between you can do better than this,negative
well this film doesnt have a good story and i was really disappointed with it,negative
the film has many great incredibly stupid and funny scenes the head that falls down however is not that guys head people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives,negative
this movie is truly boring i would never want to pay money to watch this i cant see any reason why people would like this thats if they actually shot it on film which they didnt,negative
give it a new name there are things we loved about the original series that being said the script you ask,negative
but what can be said about it how many times do i have to tell you no you dont understand and if anyone at all comes along,negative
not the worst movie ever made but not all that good either,negative
this movie was absolutely terrible do not waste your time with this movie,negative
the main action of the movie is nothing special forget the cover of the us video,negative
all i can say is that some people like b movies and im one of them if youre one of them too then give it a go,negative
and not in a good way and lets just say theres a reason why these movies are here because theyre not very good it starts out with dr ok i really cant believe they killed dr and then his daughter takes over which doesnt make a whole lot of sense but sure is to make another monster i know the end this movie was just weird nice guy but whatever it doesnt have to make sense this movie had a lot of those why moments to the point that i just gave up,negative
i think i should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts you really havent,negative
first of all lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made ok i know that many of you will think that im crazy but this is just my point of view like most of you all out there,negative
a s s its not so bad its good its just bad,negative
it isnt something that i would recommend to people who arent seriously into japanese fighting movies,negative
then again what do i know im only a child,negative
whats in here let me tell you hes not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them he did nothing here more than anything he did before or after ive just watched this movie so im dead already anything is better than this movie,negative
remember her theres no reason to go on with the rest of the movie the dialog has lines like life is a piece of s some hero he is too,negative
other than that theres nothing here thats worth your time,negative
now back to the movie probably the worst movie i have ever seen the plot line itself is good i would not recommend it to anyone unless they are cinematography major and want to see a what not to do example for their future work have a great day everyone,negative
i have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time the movie was boring long long and awful plot its a total waste of an hour and a half of my time in fact not bad at all its a big big big waste of time,negative
like you can expect from a movie such as this it has a very weak script but then again its not as if this movie features any good action at all,negative
i looked forward to this one but was very disappointed,negative
ok first of all i am a huge zombie movie fan who in their right mind thought that was a good idea and very badly i might add,negative
how can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others,negative
this movie was terrible to say the least the acting was not good at all,negative
i at least thought id be able to stand it but i was wrong we need to have a talk horrible and beautiful at once,negative
this is possibly the worst version of the play i have seen several times on stage apart from the movie,negative
if it is a thriller there is not enough thriller most of the characters seem to be dead inside but its not a zombie movie in fact if it is a movie there is not enough plot if its a music video well,negative
this is the sequel for the movie that needed no sequel,negative
and i always feel bad saying that because i know how hard it is to do both but it was basically a two hour waste of my life,negative
what this film needed i wouldnt waste my money on it,negative
i gave it two points just because mr as far as the rest of the cast they are simply terrible,negative
is this better than any decent zombie movie no cinematography i dont doubt most of these people will never be heard from again and it will be for good reason,negative
the humor isnt much funny either however a lot of people love this film most of them are women and thats not weird at all because this movie is all about girl power,negative
simply awful but they were directed so poorly the poor script did not help either this movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half seriously watch it maybe only for the last half hour,negative
same goes for the movie see it for yourself or dont,negative
it just doesnt work but i wont say who it is,negative
not that i recommend you to do that very bad the plot is stupid and has been done many times before only much much better also i was on the bad guys side all the time in the movie because the good guys were so stupid in fact every other movie in the world is better than this one,negative
my guess is that this director writer had something to say lets see what it could have been a b,negative
what that would probably make it the second zombie film made so what you will see is typical of the period lots of talking,negative
and her husband are boring and made me just fast forward the movie avoid it,negative
please ok oh my go and worst than all of that yes there is a worse than that they obviously sound nothing like him and i believe it may be one of the other actors in the film although i wanted to turn it off i always watch a movie to he end awful awful awful,negative
ok i love bad horror i especially love horror bad enough to make fun of it was worse and im sorry again,negative
just boring and when there was a bit of violence it was not well done at all,negative
this is really a new low in entertainment even though there are a lot worse movies out but this movie does not go in this direction wasnt he already down and out why does he do it again so all in all i just cant recommend it,negative
this is one awful movie as bad as it is this movie as the quality of being entertaining it sure made me laugh though,negative
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life period,negative
the film is very hard to follow and the plot just didnt seem to make any sense now if they could have put it all together and had it make some sense they might have had something dont waste your time on this one,negative
this series is nothing in short because believe me i could say so much more do not waste your time on this show or your money,negative
watch his movies in fast forward the really fast setting that you can only get on dvd,negative
many people here say that this show is for kids only it was so strange for me that i decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it i did not enjoy that viewing it may be,negative
is there anything that happens in this movie that is not predictable i think not everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason it was so incredibly obvious and cheap that i almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point he basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence he gets home he wants sex it might be a realistic thing but i dont know it just didnt feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general,negative
this is just another case in point and thats a strong maybe but know what,negative
this new film is a mess there was one other person in the audience when i saw it and she left about an hour into it,negative
it wasnt at all funny she doesnt have any talent as an actor what other problems could they possibly have ever,negative
everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case we get it,negative
unfortunately that is what i got the whole beginning story could have been great sounds very good hes the good guy,negative
this movie is bad its totally waste of time i dont see any point here,negative
he does not know when to stop you get the idea,negative
the script starts off ok there was still an hour to go,negative
maybe the wonder is who would want to be with this woman past an hour,negative
this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made why dont they call for outside help who knows,negative
its just sad that the character didnt really change at all i know that the movie was done at a different time maybe it wasnt supposed to be but i liked it,negative
every episode is also too much of a stand alone the acting is also quite bad,negative
not right like i said a shame of a waste,negative
but there is just nothing going on in here and that was very often if only it made any sense maybe you should check it out yourself though i dont recommend it,negative
overall this movie was decent definitely could have been better,negative
unfortunately it does or something like that its the second worst effect in the movie and what does all this lead up to,negative
how much do i love this film now im not a fan of bad films but i do love a film that is so bad its good this is one of those no seriously i think thats it,negative
the acting isnt great not that the actors are given any sort of material to work with,negative
anything except a dumb horror flick you cant have both anything can happen to anyone any time any place well of course it isnt why even say it,negative
clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age they got the eyes just right again it appears that they worked for some kids,negative
please dont waste your time as i did on this movie,negative
s the acting isnt much better too bad do go out and find that version,negative
first one was great i liked the first one a lot i wish they would have went more down those lines rather than what they did here i understand there is another one in the works,negative
if you love and are looking for a good western keep looking,negative
ok this movie is horrible its low budget with bad acting simply put this movie is not worth watching very very bad movie,negative
the audience however seemed to enjoy it so it probably its just me,negative
youll do it here please and thats just one example,negative
the battle scenes are so bad you wonder are these people for real but for what,negative
i dont get it that doesnt sound like something real horror fans would do now does it mr horror star a a,negative
there are some things i can never understand such as this movie it just doesnt make sense are people really so stupid that they would sit through this apparently so for laughs,negative
then again what do i know im only a child,negative
her picture from years after this film basically is the cover art and the back cover art and the inside cover art the same picture she is the first name in the list of stars wrong maybe if i watched it several more times i could actually figure out the plot but i dont think it would be worth the effort,negative
one of the five worst movies i have ever watched and to not get out of line again,negative
a good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope but it was let down in the end,negative
well that is where i found this movie very small role talk about supporting actress,negative
t whats the point plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie and it was stupid then as well half the scenes dont even need to be there this was cheap,negative
a movie doesnt need big money or great sets i what were they thinking,negative
it is a terrible movie terrible complete waste of time,negative
i was disappointed in this documentary this is just my opinion of course,negative
this not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as but none were put in and even before the movie is half over youll know what is being played and by whom,negative
its only a review but how bad can it be you ask,negative
i could see that but obviously the writer didnt think of that,negative
people just like him because of his looks nor is it original why it got so much attention and money is beyond me,negative
etc etc i thought to myself oh please dont go there but they are the only good thing in the movie,negative
why who knows i always try to have an open mind about low budget movies this is not one of those movies you know the plot by now im sure if youre reading this then some killing starts was that the best sound effect they could come up with right now,negative
it is difficult to rate a writer directors first effort after all it is one more movie than i have written or directed,negative
if youre looking for some fun this could be for you,negative
stop now if you care enough this film is dumb worst scene easy not funny not original not interesting not a good movie dont waste your time,negative
it even has one of those great what have we become wonderful stuff,negative
dr there is only one gore scene in the entire film too the monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes the acting is dull and you dont feel or care for anyone,negative
ok its a movie it can happen right it was hilarious,negative
whats the background whats supposed to make us care about anyone in this,negative
the film quality is terrible what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess,negative
something happened i want more from a film than this,negative
anyway the movie is stupid and is only for the viewer that like stupid movie the movie is really non sense no story line and no nothing,negative
everything about this movie is awful you can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible,negative
when i found it i watched it the movie wasnt scary that is until a few people turn up dead it was a pretty bad film creepy not scary,negative
it was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also dont watch and the ending how in the hell did the kids end up right there with him,negative
ill try to say something anyway one of the worst kind and the acting itself but its good really i think and she said it like she meant it i mean thats good dialogue and good acting right thats all part of the comedy of course or wait i might be wrong no yes im wrong but its a good movie some time soon,negative
they didnt this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one i hate him i hate him so much,negative
please do not waste your time please and the rest made up i think one is better off using the time to either read a little bit of the actual novel or simply do nothing,negative
not once just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy end sequence theres another cheesy end sequence then another definitely a movie one must watch to believe,negative
this movie is terrible terrible one of the worst movies ever stupid us,negative
rest stop may very well be the worst out of those terrible terrible film,negative
at least thats how it is in this movie dont waste your time with this one its because of movies like this,negative
even the gore is not good if you dont you may enjoy this film otherwise watch something else in general the movie is boring boring boring i cant think of a single scene thats actually done well,negative
it was absolutely awful it was a waste of money,negative
this movie is bad really bad by far the best part of the movie is the house it takes place in which is not saying much for the actual movie there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie not in the theater not on dvd not on tv never,negative
this movie is not even good for a laugh its just that bad,negative
no getting around that this was a really bad movie maybe no money to get good people,negative
not much else happens theres really not much to say about this film all you need to know is this is a very bad movie and not even worth viewing as a so bad its good flick,negative
first of all i dont see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie,negative
this movie is bad i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie,negative
by far this has to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life,negative
its such an incredibly horrible film how was it ever made dont waste your life dont watch even one moment of this film,negative
the direction is incredibly bad there is a little bit of blood and violence the acting is really bad rest of the cast are terrible,negative
i did not watch all this movie it didnt because i feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made,negative
i actually saw this movie at a theater this movie didnt make anyone in the theater laugh not even once,negative
this movie is high on story but low on character,negative
i watched this film when i was a kid and i thought it was terrible then now that im older i found it just as terrible to me that was a cheap shot,negative
the things he did were awful enough why try to make it worse,negative
this film is lame lame lame ive never done that really if you really like watching good movies dont waste you time with this one,negative
many of the actors in this movie are so much better than this,negative
i watched half of this movie and i didnt like it boring who are these men why does he kill one and let another one go,negative
it was all i could do to sit through it or at least an attempt at it only we dont care for these people go figure save your money rent it on dvd and laugh through it as i did,negative
mr seriously thats just about all the character does for someone whos been an actor as long as mr,negative
this film is horrible bad acting bad writing bad music its just horrible,negative
not even original in the plot is there no original thought left in hollywood,negative
which is fine and it ends of course with a happy ending,negative
nature films seem to be best done by the british at the moment,negative
they then happen about the home of dr then the good doctor gets down to work in this low budget horror comedy,negative
i mean seriously thats the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard in my life oh and wait it gets better i have never seen such a piece of crap in my life how the hell are we supposed to feel good after that horrible ending nothing came out of this i want those two hours of my life back that i wasted watching this piece of,negative
okay guess not sex with dead people and whats the message behind it all,negative
i guess it works for them or at least it has not sure about the future though,negative
this is one of the worst movies i saw dont waste your time watching this,negative
i was not expecting a classic but at least a funny film there were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more the movie is bad dont waste your time to watch it,negative
watch this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason,negative
you dont know whether to laugh at the film or with it,negative
we couldnt even get all the way through it the dialog the acting everything about it was just beyond lame,negative
the film didnt have a clear direction much too slow getting to any sort of pay off if you can call it that,negative
what else is there gore none or at least very little yes there are love scenes,negative
thats probably the only good thing about this movie and even she doesnt seem to have her heart completely in it or rather not work with,negative
when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies you get what you pay for i would probably never watch this movie again the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse just your average movie,negative
the movie is bad nothing special just a kid movie with no serious thing in it,negative
saw this on french tv today and was most disappointed so i really dont know what kind of point this film was trying to make after all a film must be entertaining,negative
this movie is one of the worst ive ever seen do not see this flick,negative
this movie was terrible the acting was lame but its hard to tell if someone was acting well since the writing was so bad,negative
i didnt like it at all but i never thought that a worse part would ever be made in the future without a screenplay without a director and without actors i dont understand how can a film be made waste of money and waste of time shame,negative
it seems that he wants her i disappointed with this character this is my opinion and i will try to tell why to make love with me to go out with me see why i mean that at this point what does the movie say then what totally not no no no no,negative
why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me,negative
i thought it would worth viewing its just boring some more to kill,negative
i loved every word how did this happen not pretty did you read this book,negative
i saw that and thought all right i always make time for the really bad films i know what youre thinking i have to see this movie the sad thing though is that you cant find it oh no just wait,negative
i couldnt believe it was it true interesting leave this one lost in space,negative
i think they really let the quality of the dvd production get away from them,negative
bad editing bad music bad acting i however did know when to stop and did please,negative
i dont know how he came up with this film but this is not a movie and the background music says but it ends up with this but it is wasted behind this film making,negative
its in black and white it has no name actors,negative
that sounds like a fantastic movie well thats what i thought the main character is boring the movie felt like it was two hours and some change,negative
she decided to take the money her final scene with her daughter,negative
my brother is in love with this show lets get this straight except nothing makes me laugh on that show one more thing the dog is so annoying,negative
and the acting which character isnt annoying its just bad and annoying i cant believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb,negative
this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
unfortunately this is one of the films problems if all that wasnt enough the acting isnt great either,negative
in fact i would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that i have yet seen and believe me i have seen plenty especially in the last few years i,negative
what a terrible terrible film one of the worst movies i have seen in my life i expected something predictable and i didnt mind,negative
i have seen what i thought were the worst of the worst b s until i saw this movie unfortunately it is not the actual end of the movie it isnt there are times when people want to see how bad something really is but this movie is not worth it put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again,negative
just watched this film and it actually made me want to write my first comment on imdb youre cool,negative
than we begin to see the two points of view,negative
this movie was awful the ending was absolutely horrible their performances were excellent well an actual movie there was nothing special about any of the characters it never happened it wasnt even a story the entire movie takes place in a days worth of time thats it if you can even call it a movie,negative
hell i would have done it for free it was,negative
it was a decent movie i actually kind of enjoyed it i dont know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke i was very disappointed,negative
something told me to you know watch it first i still dont really know or care i dont know who she was in real life or who she was in this film the editing was horrible theres a place for it i understand there are many people who liked this movie,negative
is she going crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead back then i liked it but i was young seeing it now i realize how bad it is still it does have some good things about it all in all its definitely not a good movie it didnt even look this bad on tv,negative
this was a real let down for me the action was poor in this one as well,negative
you have no idea a i had to leave because it was so bad,negative
also the weird look of the movie doesnt help much than just dont say anything at all mr the actors still did their very best the story and movie is far from original,negative
this was far and away the worst movie ive ever seen in my entire life it was slow boring not scary not funny not dramatic not entertaining avoid,negative
i pretty much knew the plot going in we dont know exactly what the hell shes doing half the time what shes after or why shes doing it so what,negative
no one in the movie can actually act including the head the plot is slow weak and the ending is so badly done,negative
if this movie was made two years earlier it could have been a lot better oh how wrong they were im sure a lot of us would though,negative
many writers tried to copy it they all did a bad job or almost the movie wasnt very long and this is a very good thing the only one you cannot laugh because it is too serious that is a bad thing because in almost each b series sci fi film you can laugh during the whole time these are much better,negative
the acting is excellent in this film with some great actors this is not a comedy this is not a comedy,negative
seriously i mean i like comedy as much as the next guy but this film had nothing to laugh at or with i like nearly all of the actors in this film just ridiculous and not even in a funny way,negative
beyond the words the rest of the cast is original isnt it i told myself well cool i was dead wrong well who said never,negative
especially if you love horrible movies when i first started watching it all i could say was i hope theres a dance sequence in it,negative
i said to myself so i thought it might have been a try i was wrong dead wrong what the crap and nothing was really,negative
and i didnt think it could possibly get any worse it did there are a few good things though the characters dialogue direction and acting were all poorly done definitely do not pay to see this i give it out of ten stars,negative
the movie was just not good the only thing that was well done about this movie was the music these songs are so good not worth your money but the soundtrack is,negative
is it supposed to be a black comedy this is truly one of the worst films ever made there i said what everyone else is thinking,negative
the acting was not horrible it wasnt the greatest though,negative
but i guess not a serious waste of time b,negative
its a shame too because i think it could have been a good movie but these characters add up to nothing awful,negative
i just got through watching this dvd at home we watched it all the way through and as someone else said however if you want a real western you will hate this movie,negative
in fact the best number in the film are for her love is where you find it,negative
i think this story is not worth telling however i think the actors did the best they could with a lame story,negative
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone,negative
theyre a mess who are these people do you really care does it matter just give us your money please because we sure dont care about anything else an absolutely terrible movie,negative
if you feel you must see this film rent it at the most,negative
it wasnt this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour what is this about we never find out what is the point we have no idea dont rent it,negative
its horrible its absolutely awful hes a totally different dog and while it isnt horrible i dont like it no mention at all of her in the second film or something of the sort dont watch this if youre looking for a wonderful sequel,negative
talk about your waste of money that was wonderful so what made him do this one i watched it and thought it was really dumb that one was so hilarious like this one was,negative
i watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time,negative
who me thats what it really says on the video case this for some reason makes all men kill each other this is enough to make all the men kill each other go figure this isnt really a space flick doesnt work so well here did i hear that right perhaps not,negative
this was a decent movie for the first half then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard the why in the world would he they do that,negative
this is the first one ive seen after this im not sure i want to see any more,negative
then the second half of this movie is hard to follow he is the father that part is not well told in the film its like the film shows this to happen in a day,negative
its hard to see how anyone could take this film seriously even while giving it a bad review,negative
now first let me say i love god awful movies i had to turn it off it was so bad,negative
i wont even bring up the acting since there are no actors in this film,negative
first of all let me make it clear what this movie didnt have was for example scary moments good acting and a good script it wasnt very entertaining either yes so it does,negative
apparently mr how many times did the girl say oh no i cant have this baby and oh no here it comes,negative
and then there is the type we know from later films like the night of the living dead and the evil dead both have their moments in various movies over the years,negative
this is a total waste of time for all viewers whether or not they are into horror movies,negative
hes extremely bad as well whatever it did have some hilarious moments,negative
this movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex,negative
this is just bad now thats a movie i cant wait to see,negative
and what was with the black and white at the beginning makes no sense rent for entertainment not quality,negative
the acting was terrible i wont go on and on but this movie was a mess,negative
and the special effects arent that special the story itself is actually interesting and i own the video oh well,negative
well i had the chance to view this film the other day truly sad,negative
even the real bad guys get killed off too easily without too much of a fight but where did she get it from i dont think i will be watching this one over and over again,negative
it just isnt there too bad but given the story i doubt anything more could be made of this unfortunately this was their only film together,negative
that is what mr watch everything that has horror written on the dvd cover,negative
okay so i just got back i didnt it just wasnt scary which isnt saying much she comes in lets see here scene check check well you got it i could but thats about it very bad,negative
i mean its so hilarious it just has to be made who was this person and the story nothing in this film is funny nothing it just goes on and on its truly that lame i love films that are so bad theyre good this is so bad its but that really means little,negative
of course all told this film is pretty bad whats taken me so long to realize this,negative
this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together well theres nothing wrong with that except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together the movie has no plot it works at times but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over its a hit you over the head with it kind of comedy,negative
this movie is incredibly boring the acting is bad and the plot doesnt make any sense its hard to write a good review because i have no idea what the movie was really about,negative
the plot is hard to follow if there is one at all,negative
i was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end,negative
this is definitely one of the worst i have ever seen,negative
this movie is a mess it is poorly written it is poorly directed save your money,negative
it was stupid this movie was awful little in the plot makes any sense and the ending,negative
what are the good things oh i was supposed to say whats good about this film and often there wasnt even any point to it and then the ending,negative
ive read all the comments on this film as such i read the book upon which this film was based,negative
i cant believe some people actually like this which its not or whatever mr,negative
at least season one had a few good stories here and there,negative
i cant believe anyone liked this movie there was nothing scary about this movie at all thats because most of it was written by the same person and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie a complete waste of my time and money,negative
that alone says what to expect of this movie and it was a movie whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer this is the history,negative
the look of the film is all wrong dont ask me whos who though its just bad,negative
many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent and dont even ask about the acting,negative
i kept expecting it to have some good stuff since all of these people had been cool in other films but it never came through,negative
you know from the first ten minutes where its going,negative
i mean even after reading this review please stay away from this flick,negative
if youre thinking that this makes absolutely no sense youre not alone it gets worse well it actually gets better but not before getting much much worse,negative
how could things get any worse this film is lame,negative
what i wouldnt do to give this film a re write,negative
how wrong i was for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear period,negative
the thing is they could have probably made it a good movie man what a waste,negative
please do not go see this there were only three characters in this movie so it was amazing how bad the character development was this really was awful,negative
i said before that ive never seen a bad english actor this movie has quite a few bad ones usually i think people are too hard on directors and actors you get the picture,negative
i mean really you dont make a movie then make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel with different characters and actors i mean it would have been ok if this want a home alone movie but they did make it a home alone movie,negative
the music for one is terrible i guess you get the point by now this movie is slow to get to the action and once we get there we sort of wonder when the thing is going to finally call it a day well i cant remember a single line of dialogue other than run,negative
this movie was a complete waste of time the soundtrack was bad story was lame and predictable and the acting was terrible after the first ten minutes the rest of the film was completely obvious,negative
now ive got to watch this in horror movies might want to think about that before making another political horror movie god help us,negative
with all the big name actors in this film i can not believe how bad it was do not rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life,negative
and where do i even begin with the problems of this dvd the story the characters and all i could remember about this movie was how bad it makes me feel after seeing it,negative
it was as if she did not want to even be in the movie everyone else was excellent,negative
its not worth your time i cant believe i told you as much as i did no stars,negative
this has got to be the worst movie let alone western i have ever seen and the ending completely awful dont waste your time,negative
where do i begin with the killing mind before i mention the good bit,negative
animation is good but not quite good enough storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous ive ever come across and thats saying a lot,negative
i mean nothing happened there is no story the script is a joke its just awful i doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it,negative
im serious an enjoyable waste of time but it definitely is a waste of time,negative
but its all for nothing and what do we do with it,negative
the same goes for the rest of the characters i never get to know them,negative
she wasnt it works she has the kid i kid you not its that bad,negative
please as far as production goes there isnt any bad acting bad writing,negative
next i thought this movie had been done years ago then it would have been kind of scary lets talk about the special effects given that it is the main character you would think some serious money would have been put into it but that isnt so but the idea is so far out there that its stupid what country is dr they didnt did they have to kill the little dog why did i watch the whole thing,negative
the movie is a total crap the story is a crap that is a dream in itself,negative
it isnt one major thing that makes the movie not work on this one that game was over from the start,negative
lets film this this is horrible i just cant believe ive spent an hour and a half of my life on something like this,negative
there are some really good ideas here but they just dont work this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap,negative
it looked like a home video it is that bad it is absolutely boring and terrible,negative
we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play just terrible,negative
this film is about a party put together by the high school scary girl what actually happened there in the past,negative
this movie is such a total waste of time great comedy bad action flick,negative
does no one else remember i am mr you have seen this all before and better,negative
he does a pretty good job in it not great but not bad,negative
it is a one joke show and the joke is not particularly funny t t,negative
yet again not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable in fact this one is just boring dull dull dull dull dull,negative
its been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad one of the first scenes the one with the television show where the hell are you,negative
for some reason it didnt work here not setting herself up so easily no it didnt work,negative
if you feel you can like this film dont let my review stop you there is nothing here oh well,negative
thought not keep that music down young man this isnt the worst film in the world and in many ways i enjoyed it,negative
so its a space movie but its low budget you ask what about the effects the effects are at times good and at times really really bad i mean bad theres a story here but its told in what i think is the wrong order and some effects i wasnt expecting much but i was still disappointed two out of ten stars,negative
like everything in this film its badly done but nothing more,negative
so whats my problem well three things so all in all a waste of a good idea and a great cast,negative
it is the poor story and dialogue however that makes this movie so entertaining to watch,negative
perhaps the second half of the movie was better than the first but i find that hard to believe,negative
the budget does really show which in this day and age should not,negative
what a bad bad movie the one funny thing is that i watched the killer cut version of the movie more sex,negative
of course something goes wrong or there would be no movie right,negative
unfortunately in this film hes given absolutely nothing its a shame as i really wanted to love this film but couldnt,negative
where to begin well ill start with the characters t too predictable out of,negative
pretty bad why did he hate the dog kind of dull not a great movie in any way,negative
now as for the actual the actual movie oh boy,negative
but you will love it anyway but you will be thinking about it for a while after you see it,negative
perhaps i went into this film with the wrong idea without giving the ending away i thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in political cinema history,negative
have i seen a worse movie no i cant say that i have the dialog is the worst ive ever heard what kind of writer did they have on this film or was he trying to get the director killed by the few people who saw this,negative
first the script second the acting are you getting the picture,negative
i have to say that the stories are really weak who knows maybe that may have been the problem,negative
maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie,negative
we tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest i just dont get it i thought i would get it interesting and still it had dead stuff inside,negative
what i got was actually not that bad the special effects were absolutely horrible but i found the movie itself quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent the acting wasnt that bad and overall i had fun watching this movie,negative
there is no reason to see this movie the acting is awful,negative
but this movie is perhaps more like a love story well in this movie she does look beautiful,negative
he tries to find out why how is that supposed to happen exactly,negative
then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending i mean that makes no sense,negative
one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman,negative
i didnt know about this at all one of my friends told me about this thats all and some more it is just sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch,negative
in fact it doesnt look like they had any money really no problem check,negative
the brother of the king appears on the scene the king bad actor the brother also a bad actor,negative
if you can watch it by yourself it isnt that bad if you can watch it with one single friend its bad but could be a lot worse but it isnt a good film nothing ive seen a lot worse in better films im sure there is worse,negative
they get down to business straight away but find little of any interest this is a pretty poor film in my opinion what is dr why are none of the characters given any background overall i was very disappointed and i was expecting a lot better a horror film with only one on screen death and only three in total whats the world coming too,negative
but how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning middle and end,negative
what was he thinking oh the film was hard enough to follow without that as well,negative
very slow development could have done so much more at the end,negative
there is a lot of wasted talent and time here,negative
actually less however whatever experience he had coming up to this one doesnt show take it or leave it,negative
i guess there were a lot of movies like this,negative
but almost before the movie starts you know exactly what is going to happen but if you like these kind of movies you will probably enjoy this one,negative
ten minutes the screen goes dark hit me on the head if this was done in a single take i thought i would rate five a five but four is what it deserves,negative
this film is so bad i cant believe it was actually shot did we really watch the same movie everything is bad in this film the story is there a story yes it goes that far a big huge waste of money,negative
several parts of the movie are showing it it seems that this crew is here just for having fun,negative
i didnt care about the characters the characters spent their time getting high and believe me thats the only way to sit through this movie,negative
this leads to well nothing youre watching the wrong movie if thats what youre after im political if he doesnt he certainly should,negative
well lets start at the quality why the series was perfect,negative
it was just terrible his film is the one to see avoid this mess,negative
the first half hour or so of this movie i liked,negative
i was really disappointed by this movie the direction seemed off too,negative
the plot there are some other people there who are simply too awful to write about the end and those special effects well theyre special all right,negative
i want to say the acting is bad but i think it was the directing that made it so,negative
i wont point them out what if all they took from the written work was the title title it something else hollywood could not do this alone,negative
in fact i want my money back what a waste of time what else can i say he is free in the beginning and hes free at the end in my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word,negative
unfortunately i did make it all the way through make sure that you do not,negative
believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get,negative
seriously and now this i love movies that are so bad theyre good,negative
three times five times i think even god would say good call getting past those its enjoyable for what it is,negative
this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen we were wrong is that it end it now,negative
to learn how not to make a film lets see what did the crew mess up in this flick it still would have been awful what was that oh not possible none a perfect example of how not to make a flick,negative
which turns out to be less than a year yes,negative
the story behind this movie is very interesting and in general the plot is not so bad first off action sequences are you okay,negative
this movie made me think but the movie itself let me tell you a story for some reason i decided to watch the special features before i watched the actual movie not something that i usually do the movie the actors its not a movie i would recommend though,negative
they are all white but i will stop here a previous movie of his was ok but this is terrible,negative
the actors were actually decent trying to make the best of a ridiculous script,negative
the movie was pretty bad its not so much a script problem,negative
at least get people who look the age what do you expect whatever no wonder they didnt show the car getting hit if thats what it was sad one second then hard rock the next this was a horrible low budget movie,negative
i like that the acting was decent i tried to like the film i really did,negative
its supposed to be a comedy does it have to do with the budget this film,negative
then you come to writing it so it all looks good up to actually making it nothing much happens another fight big fight again and the end sounds great doesnt it,negative
no this movie is horrible im sure everyone would love that a horrible horrible horrible film,negative
this movie has absolutely nothing good about it the acting is among the worst i have ever seen what is really amazing is that everyone is awful not just a few here and there everyone dumb dumb dumb again what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are cheesy,negative
it is easily one of the worst movies ever made no surprise why no one else has written comments on the imdb avoid it,negative
so bad its hilarious if you want to see bad acting bad script and special effects gone wrong this is the movie for you,negative
what could be better than that t t then its over t no this film isnt terrible what happened here why is this movie so bad,negative
with that said this is not a good movie on any level it is quite dull and the acting overall is very very poor,negative
the story was over after the first movie i wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on,negative
to the audience this film makes fun of itself better than we could,negative
i dont care what anyone says this movie was crap the only thing it had going for it was camera work which was very well done as for the dialogue i have heard so many people talk about another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture,negative
and of course they had to use the dog story again as for me id rather die than see it one more time,negative
i was wrong by god is it awful the story itself was not very good it did nothing of the sort what really this movie is not worth your time,negative
but forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before,negative
through most of the film if youre a die hard thriller fan its worth seeing at least once wait,negative
i saw this movie with my girlfriend i really cant understand why someone would think that would be entertaining it shows another scene where dr instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother i think they should have left all of that out,negative
this could be one of the worse movies ive ever seen this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different,negative
dont waste your time with this movie unless you are in it for a good laugh and how dumb it is,negative
after watching this i was left with the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie,negative
this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time awful acting awful script and they were the good points one to definitely miss,negative
but this film is a black mark on his career very stupid it is really not difficult to make a film such as this,negative
if you doubt me please look at my other reviews however for the first time ever i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over i love bad movies however there is not a single good thing i can say about this film the special effects are bad the acting is bad i will tell you anything,negative
after seeing the film for myself i could see why however the film itself definitely is not unfortunately this is all the good i can really say of the film,negative
my point he is done every movie is the same we can only hope s so i have to write ten lines about this movie is that ten,negative
well just say something like or did the book find her didnt buy it for a second did i understand the movie of course not again of course not,negative
the director didnt seem to be saying look at this film it seemed as if he were saying look at me im a director,negative
but i call it like i see it come on this movie could have been better,negative
and what is this what a crap its stupid and really really boring its the worst of the series it could have been much better,negative
in the case of be cool everything went to waste this film tried too hard to get the audience to laugh hes a completely different person in this sequel everything about this film was a big question mark i just didnt understand the point to anything a,negative
it also leaves the thought is there a series to follow,negative
dr im sure if id read the book the story would have made a bit more sense,negative
for a movie i was really looking forward to i was very disappointed,negative
this is by far the worst movie i have ever watched,negative
very cool idea thats not art why is it so difficult to make it sound right,negative
having said that this movie is by far in my opinion the worst movie ive ever seen i thought the acting was terrible was there any i dont think so,negative
to me that was the first problem with this movie,negative
this movie was extremely boring usually i dont write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments what more can i say i think it is the point itself,negative
this movie was in one word terrible the movie was stupid and no effort or thought was put into it,negative
but did hollywood give her the lead she killed the film,negative
this movie is very boring and not really worth watching,negative
this is a pretty bad movie overall good for a laugh not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be,negative
however this one is not this is one of them,negative
this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone,negative
dont waste time on this even if youre a horror fan,negative
it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie,negative
this is why i think her character might be gay lots of other good actors appear in the film as well,negative
if you dont want to know how the movie ends dont read this review not so,negative
my friends and i watched this movie last night by all means this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen sounds about right of the film itself so boring its really funny at parts but also really stupid and annoying,negative
who does something like that and believe me when i say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie,negative
yes why there are others a few why i wonder a bad joke what the hell was it,negative
i usually love these movies give me a good old b movie any day but this one was simply awful the acting this movie had absolutely nothing going for it i think they were probably right,negative
even the dog is black apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie now you can do it too,negative
the all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good theres no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself so he can appear in the film,negative
this is my second review because its so bad the girl on the cover is hot but the girl in the movie is not really crap film,negative
can we say stupid i couldnt wait for it to end the acting was terrible this was a waste of two hours of my life can i get them back that would have been more entertaining,negative
in other words the whole thing is really stupid and they didnt it is not worth your eyes,negative
case no how stupid anyway i dont know what it was all about but it doesnt its boring,negative
just have a look at what he as done so far why did i watch this movie you just sit there watching feeling nothing,negative
yet if you didnt live at that time it was well before my time you wonder why anyone liked this sort of entertainment its all played for laughs and its really not a horror movie despite the cast,negative
this is a total waste of money the production is poor the special effects are terrible,negative
and the acting was pretty bad as well what a dog of a movie,negative
and thats what makes it great it works with good movies too doesnt mean hes wrong though they were dumb but they were funny and thats exactly why it works,negative
but to my surprise the movie is at least two years older then the original where to start on this movie yet the school still thought it was a cool idea for them to let him go the sound was so horrible in this movie,negative
you are wrong the only good thing with the movie is that it that it has an end and that it has a rather short running time,negative
of course okay why do they leave them there outside their place,negative
the dialogue the acting the cinematography the sound editing the editing in general the plot etc etc so what is really good about this bad movie,negative
obviously nothing in this particular one none of that happens,negative
okay it was very good but best picture please not even close since way before that get real and get with it,negative
this truly is so bad its good you have to see this movie,negative
it wasnt if you dont you will never be able to get through the film,negative
no it wasnt are you still following this good theres just one problem they dont want him to leave still with me why should they we all know how bad they can get,negative
i watched this movie and all i can say is this,negative
i did not i was able to sit through it but it was close,negative
i might have been part of that audience but still i got as good as nothing out of it when watching it now,negative
seriously to john the director you are terrible at directing,negative
it was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time most of it was just people talking about the place,negative
after that maybe you can make something of her thats all hes not a bad guy not a good one why didnt they do something with him who may come to life but nothing happens in short no plot oh poor me,negative
even less of an idea of what is supposed to be going on in this movie half the time yet it still kept me sort of interested i guess its no surprise that the film looks good unfortunately some of the acting is beyond bad the sound is also pretty bad,negative
he was yet to see the movie and boy was he in for a surprise,negative
thats when the killing begins but not in a good way thats because it is some though are interesting but overall this isnt a piece that would be known for its acting,negative
it is just as cheap as the entire production an enjoyable piece if you have the time but do not expect anything more,negative
several characters are poorly cast too which brings me to my final point and i think one of the most important,negative
it just cant gore indeed and lots of it well made gore no way,negative
the sequel was not it seemed as if he wasnt even interested in doing the sequel his acting was good but it could have been better but ill do it the role didnt make sense and it should have been thought out a little better it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more but it didnt work in this one there were too many characters in this sequel all of them except for a few had no reason to be there not to mention that the writing was horrible,negative
was this movie good it wasnt a movie at all,negative
why are there no good reviews this is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did,negative
you know the one is it really that hard to make a scary movie dont go into the movie,negative
the direction is poor or perhaps better put made to look poor finally the action well its poor,negative
i dont like the character at all just because of money or what,negative
do not waste your money or your time on this movie,negative
t s t s t s t s t s t s,negative
this is a great movie i love the series on tv and so i loved the movie that was great i loved it it was pretty funny too its a great movie,negative
the worst part in the film are the lines stand not upon the order of your going but go,negative
i guess it could be called so bad its good the story is nothing new and has been done better it is not worth more than one watch,negative
this is where the fun begins this is truly scary,negative
dont watch this film i cant think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad,negative
do not open and finally the end is as open as an end can be,negative
because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away come everyone can make a movie but not all will be just as good,negative
i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie there was no real plot terrible script terrible acting life is to short to waste your time with this movie,negative
what else can we add that should work unfortunately thats about the only good thing that can be said for it yes,negative
the only horror in this thing is watching it no wait,negative
i kept on telling my friend how this movie has a great story plot and perhaps a good one,negative
i would not however laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh really or really really poor character writing,negative
the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls,negative
but is it enjoyable in a bad movie kind of way sort of,negative
lets talk about slow far from it this film just isnt there,negative
she does it in all her movies anyway in my opinion this film is not worth watching,negative
i thought this was an extremely bad movie was this guy coming back who knows you certainly wont after watching this movie,negative
man i cant believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed,negative
i didnt really like this film but i havent exactly seen it,negative
didnt at all turn out that way what kind of message is that,negative
im not sure that i enjoyed this much it was a little strange,negative
it had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her,negative
an okay film with a fine leading lady but a terrible leading man shes the best actor of the bunch,negative
in my experience it was just not strong enough my wife and i were well how can i say this,negative
first of all let me say that i had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie the plot is weak plot which plot,negative
i admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on british tv at the moment but really s s,negative
i expected all of that to be bad and it is,negative
right wrong it just seems like such a waste there was really no story the dialog was terrible is anyone there the characters were the effects were terrible anything to happen but no great oh again and now for the violence ok nothing really happens again oh now they run around again oh right ok maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen no oh cool the end oh crap and finally since im so full of myself ill tell you this making cool movies is easy it could have been so great,negative
though im not sure how much he probably had fun doing it but it doesnt help the movie much its okay one might watch it once when she was fighting,negative
this film is so bad you cant imagine thats real cool man,negative
yes indeed it could have been a good movie an interesting story unfortunately badly told about the acting,negative
but even if the editing were better the film would not be john of all people,negative
what else more should i say to you viewers out there,negative
thats the question you have to ask yourself when you watch this movie what was the point ok time for the story thats pretty much all that happens for about half the movie so eventually all the girls get killed off he says its because he saw it but how we do love you whatever i could go on and on about this movie but i dont see the need,negative
how can something so awful score this high when they got home oh my what a fun movie,negative
i have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this film to the director and the writers of this film this movie should never have a sequel ever,negative
this person should never make another movie ever please never watch this movie,negative
which film am i talking about could still be any horror film you say,negative
so what is wrong with the movie they both feature mr what is it i dont think so but dont ask me i only know i didnt enjoy any of this i admit i am a big fan,negative
but she said that she cant remember to much of it whatever it wasnt all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments,negative
i would like to see another movie on this story but done by different people,negative
this was obviously a low budget film it shows in every scene what is nice to see is where it was made,negative
everyone has done this one we know why they die we know who the killer is we know how it was done so i say enough already mr i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb i hope he doesnt look that way in real life somehow i dont think so,negative
the only part of the film i enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed the only thing dr,negative
the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t show,negative
and everything they do is done without reason the story is weird but stupid the actors play their stupid characters very well im not telling they are stupid but i mean they are very bad actors dont rent it,negative
i didnt buy it the daughter is not believable in her job role this is a sad movie with a stupid ending,negative
watch this film however good on them for getting in there and having a go,negative
after viewing it i came to the opinion that it was nothing special which ive already seen what,negative
is this some sort of joke he thought it was good what was it supposed to be the plot is stupid,negative
a friend gave me this movie because she liked it i decided i would finally watch it it got worse or maybe not,negative
the acting wasnt bad but it wasnt that good either it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by and what wasnt predictable was done so badly that it didnt matter the ending was not worth watching at all maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one,negative
t dont get me wrong okay then dont admit it,negative
although usually shes never used as more than a pretty face in most of her film tv roles usually small parts she has done much better,negative
quite one of the worst films i have ever seen apparently based on true events though,negative
ok so it started its that bad what the hell was this director thinking,negative
but it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting,negative
it is a shame that such a great book was turned into such a terrible movie i could not wait to see this movie after reading the book,negative
i just didnt see any horror it wasnt scary to me at all and it never told us what happened to her father i was very disappointed,negative
much less great at least her role was extremely small okay what does he do,negative
oh my oh this is a really bad movie it is simply and after all a bad movie avoid it enough said,negative
ill start with saying come on wasnt that bad was it how so people would ask ill tell you how see what its all about who knows you might like it a bit,negative
and a few more no s on top of that what exactly is it trying to do tell a story never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less,negative
theyre just working with what theyre given the problem was the script there was nothing believable about it at all,negative
the fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it if you ever see the cover of the video youll be able to read them,negative
i always say theres nothing like a good movie and i must say this was nothing like a good movie was there even a story big waste of time,negative
overall this movie was annoying really however i watched the whole movie so it had to be somewhat entertaining,negative
and so on but theres this problem even so it makes no sense,negative
need i go on hes a great actor as are the entire cast,negative
this is absolutely the worst movie ive seen all year first i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the cast,negative
what waste of talent and money what could have been a great movie for all actors turned out to be a b movie at best i was very disappointed in this film and im telling everyone not to see it and the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the film,negative
ive enjoyed extremely long films before pretty much anything interesting that happens during the course of the film happens off screen see,negative
i kept thinking it must get better it got worse and worse yes the acting was good but the movie was very very very bad worst movie ever,negative
where she also meets her friends then falls apart as for blood and violence forget it,negative
what happened no wait i know youre going to enjoy the next two hours,negative
awful is really all one needs to know first think of all the things that could be bad about a movie and then try to make a movie that is bad in all of these ways except maybe in one or two of the bad guys,negative
good actors good director well acted well directed but nothing seems to happen in this film nothing at all what was he thinking about did he really think that this was a good movie and if he didnt then why did he made it,negative
this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen,negative
bad script check awful effects check horrible actors check lame direction check what i got instead was the worst film ever made if you are the type that wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is this is for you you were all horrible i mean really bad,negative
is this funny does the film need it does it ever get a laugh im pretty sure every action from the characters in this film are far from realistic well it doesnt we are watching them have a good time by the end of the film we hate them for all the fun they are having either one it doesnt work,negative
but at least theyre believable when they do it this movie couldnt even get that right i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else whos thinking of watching this movie will think again its awful,negative
i cant believe some of the comments here in the reviews,negative
this is part of the rest do something else with your time read a book anything really,negative
and the ending makes little sense in fact the whole movie makes little sense and i cant recommend it at all if it didnt take itself so serious i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy,negative
it has terrible acting and the worst directing ive seen yet,negative
there isnt that much to talk about but thats ok but if you dont take it too seriously you can have fun watching it,negative
i would give it one star all these elements are awful,negative
great way to get the movie started yes its her its a shame shes not in the movie a whole lot more than she is,negative
thats not enough if they are based on real people then i feel very very sorry for them not that i think very much of him either,negative
that said im very interested in the subject and i enjoy a scary story as much as the next guy for the rest of us i recommend you avoid,negative
well acted too well its a very long film it took me four years to make it and its it is very long this is what he said whats he talking about yes i absolutely loved the first half hour yes yes yes i get all of this really i do,negative
as crazy as it sounds that last one wasnt a joke,negative
as they see it the musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap overall if you liked the original youll hate this,negative
this film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie i have ever seen,negative
this is not the movie it had bad special effects i mean really bad special effects it really is a pretty bad movie,negative
where have i seen this before it turns out i have seen it before but in a movie made much later than this one,negative
i could not for the life of me follow figure out or understand the story,negative
i dont think whether anything was right with this movie at all,negative
where was a good musical number where was the classic theme song i mean really,negative
that was the only good thing well a wait is a wait however a wait is boring and yes this wait was boring too,negative
this movie starts out as if it were a comedy,negative
i own this movie i wouldnt go that far but maybe in his time he was,negative
this movie is absolutely horrible i would not recommend this movie to anyone and i wish i could take it back where i got it from do not waste your time or money on this movie,negative
how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me,negative
this town is dull and so is this film this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasnt any,negative
the ending well as soon as i saw where it was going i knew what was going to happen not very original mr i hope to see more from all involved in this film but i think it will play better on home video than in the theater sorry,negative
but too bad but i really dont understand why this has such a high score on imdb s,negative
along with the terrible production comes the bad actors the plot was very simple however if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night this would be a pretty good one my friends and i had a good time watching this awful,negative
i cant remember when ive heard such bad dialogue it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible,negative
the acting was very very good but that was about it good acting like i said,negative
the problems with this movie are many you dont believe anything from the get go as a result is this a comedy or a horror movie despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid avoid,negative
terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what i cant think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isnt too long it is terrible,negative
this is all she has in life she just doesnt have what it takes to do a lead role,negative
i dont mind the stupid jokes i can live with the silly story theres not much more to be said about this one it is definitely not funny,negative
i didnt although in ways it has its moments but thats where it ends unfortunately this is very far from the case whats come over me if the acting was better this movie would have been okay but since i do im probably never going to watch it again once was enough,negative
it is the worst film i have seen in a long time,negative
let me start by saying how much i love the tv series,negative
i dont you cant get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film,negative
next up was the first house of the dead movie good cast but a pretty bad movie,negative
and looking straight into the camera he put his face in the camera too much and then when the guy falls off the car wouldnt you expect him to be dead i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing,negative
the first movie of this series was well written and original,negative
otherwise the film was just sort of interesting they never sound like what you think the actor actress would sound like in real life the fight scenes were not as long and boring as most fight scenes so that was good,negative
it seems strange i know and it is i can call it a terrible horror movie yes thats why its so hard to rate this movie,negative
boy was i ever wrong everything that happens is just to kill time what a shame do not watch this crap,negative
but ive seen some of those and they actually look better than this did anything ive nothing else to say about it,negative
the end thats it ive never seen such a dull movie in my life they dont care about anything they dont even try to stop them or do something to make things better,negative
i know there are probably some worse ones out there that i just havent seen yet but i have seen this and this is the worst how did she make it on the cover,negative
wish it was kept that way what kind of a hero is that why did we not get different characters here this was stupid,negative
how can anyone not see whats going on is he that stupid i didnt but shes not even that,negative
i didnt like it at all i watch it with several people first of all there is no talent i really wish someone could really do a good film on this one when you watch this movie the little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about parts of it looked like what a person might film on a home video camera this is probably how this movie was put together someone said i like this story doesnt matter if we dont know how to act as long as we get it on film and say it is good,negative
this is such a film i just dont get that,negative
this movie was bad the story was bad the acting was bad otherwise,negative
despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie i really liked it this one however yes there are some good jokes believe me they dont do anything funny while being here,negative
what is it what is it makes less sense than dr maybe a little more what is it it felt like ok this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way it didnt feel interesting and was quite boring dr,negative
i like monster movies so i thought that there would be a good chance that i would like this movie there are a lot of movies that have the same problems that i have seen and enjoyed in a so bad its good kind of way but nothing interesting is going on,negative
bad acting horrible cinematography and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie,negative
some of the lines are classic in a did he really say that kind of way,negative
tell me what you see in them on seeing the second one he says i see two women having sex on seeing the third he says i see two men having sex on seeing the next one he says i see two men and two women having sex says the guy,negative
the direction you could do a better job there is no body thats about as far as i could get,negative
maybe that was the reason i watched this one to the end,negative
so she became an actress so what is it one i wouldnt be at all surprised,negative
that may have been the problem there was not one time when the camera was still ever,negative
my eyes this could very well be the worst movie ever,negative
this is an example of a movie that was not a a movie no editing poor script weak acting and not much directing,negative
well youll have to see that bit for yourself just not as often as it should,negative
well if that is the case and i did not miss anything were talking things that some people dont know about by their second or third play through,negative
we kept looking at each other with our best what the quite possibly the worst film ever made,negative
just make sure each and every one of them has a big red one s s,negative
im really disappointed by this piece of work dont waste your time with it,negative
who would come to see the movie why would they keep them,negative
dr there really isnt much to recommend this film so i wont,negative
what was the message can someone help me understand this mess of a film,negative
i dont even know what else went on and i think thats it,negative
there is no art here i have seen or own pretty much all you can get,negative
youll die if you dont change your ways look at you i hate you we all hate you dont you get it its so sad what youre doing to yourself anyway the series was a huge success funny that,negative
seriously what is this what was that stay away from this film,negative
this is one of those movies that doesnt so much have a plot as it does a premise,negative
they are way too full of themselves its awful its stupid dont see it as for the set up and directing not so bad only see this if you dont really like good music i hate to be so mean,negative
not the worst movie ive seen but definitely not very good either so what exactly is wrong with the movie,negative
its just so simple isnt it still with me good because there is more so does all this work or not,negative
but the movie has a problem what laughs there are to be had are few and far between maybe some people watch this and laugh non stop i say no we just have to keep looking for it,negative
actually it was pretty funny in a god how the hell did this movie get made kind of way if you life making fun of movies but if youre actually thinking is this a good movie so i dont know if any of what was said is fact or are they but they cant,negative
there is not too much to be told about this film try to look for something better,negative
then again what do i know im only a child,negative
well there isnt much to say about this movie very poor acting poor script and lame story and the story itself has really no point at all its total waste of money and time,negative
he had a love for directing that i wish more people in modern day hollywood had but that doesnt make his movies any more fun to watch every thing in it is true but once again that does not make it a good movie yes fun,negative
what an awful movie didnt this guy this director if you can call him that realize that the first problem child was bad enough let alone make a sequel for it,negative
with the worst acting you can ever find it is obvious the writer doesnt have kids or even care for them,negative
i loved the show new and old and i loved all the movies i think the problem was it had no drama but i would just rent it,negative
if youre a fan of the original series do not see this movie they didnt even get the look right,negative
i think their god needs to go to school or something what no i doubt it i do,negative
bad look awful story yes sure its supposed to be a comedy and all but something tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal,negative
i have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend and i thought i will enjoy watching it i was wrong,negative
in my opinion yes it is what do you make of a movie that has on the dvd cover however,negative
god i wish i watched that instead of this the movie is dull very dull the plot there was a plot music acting moving on i dont have much experience with bad films but i know bad when i see it,negative
just look at their movie until i read the reviews i say we meet once a year to view this film wait does anyone still have it,negative
me but why the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing i cant believe this movie was made at all what audience is this movie for its so bad so wrong so crap but ok we did get a laugh now and then but after that nothing could ever top that this ill leave it at that,negative
i have one question why who read this script and said sounds great original he doesnt even need a gun most times,negative
this film isnt a little bad its not even kind of bad actually hes all right not too special if you ask me,negative
and one that goes on and on and on now the actors,negative
this this i mean anything not worth doing is not worth doing well but he did it well anyway for some strange reason my friend loved it terrible movie terrible movie idea,negative
why as for laughs there were very few and far between,negative
i am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie why would you,negative
and take it very very seriously why are they taking a simple game so seriously did i miss something was there money involved but it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it even for a low budget sci fi flick it is a very poor and cheap example,negative
this movie was seriously awful the acting was the worst at first i thought to myself well its an old movie ive seen older movies with way better acting and such the music was terrible to,negative
s life is too short and one even an american doesnt have plenty of time to waste watching this piece,negative
the acting was horrible so what do they do nothing but what do they do nothing the movie is over,negative
and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did not,negative
they never did and thats a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste mr,negative
is this a bad movie dont take my word for it im not saying dont rent it if you want to,negative
from the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end this movie is not worth your time,negative
she may as well have killed herself its really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest,negative
usually i will go for stupid if its funny but this stupid was so stupid it almost or possibly did make me stupid overall i think i have made it sound better than it is the twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway,negative
too crazy the plot was very cheesy and easy to think of,negative
i like bad films this film gives all the above a bad name yes you know going in that what youre getting is not high art or anything like it isnt very good it simply isnt very good oh by the way did i tell you that it isnt very good,negative
i couldnt even i mean look okay i can only think how,negative
t its just lame everything about this movie is stupid t even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie,negative
this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through it was okay the ending it was okay,negative
the actors were horrible ive seen better acting in middle school plays,negative
and i have always been disappointed she has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one,negative
you dont this is one of those bad movies that i dont need to watch until the ending to know its bad it it this kind of bad films in which you realize those other films you hate are not bad after all,negative
i still cant believe this movie the story is a joke but in the sense of being funny but more like no story at all you cant no it cant be this movie is too bad for all of them at the end they couldnt got so much money,negative
are they talking about the same movie i just saw,negative
i loved the blood and gore the effects were beautiful how ever there are some real problems with it its no big deal so be happy about that i thought that was rather dumb that was also dumb,negative
where to begin the music when bad movies happen to good actors,negative
come on the acting is well there is no acting the end is so far the most stupid ever made whatever,negative
i doubt that i would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film,negative
they stay in the game one season or one fight too many,negative
seriously youve just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it,negative
this was the worst film i have seen for a long time save your time do something else,negative
this one is simply stupid and not very funny at all i felt sorry for him,negative
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
i think that was part of the point i dont know but the story just wasnt very good or very interesting either well not for most of us,negative
i was left disappointed but then again the heart of the problem was the screenplay itself which isnt saying much,negative
i have seen some pretty bad movies and this is right up there so its no wonder that it didnt make much sense but the story and the telling of it just arent there,negative
so did they even have writers for this and well they did a minute and a half way to go guys,negative
this movie was made for one reason and one reason alone,negative
you know the police wont see get it the acting by all was excellent in this almost a good thriller,negative
no yes no certainly not is the problem tom is crazy did i mention that perhaps,negative
unfortunately i was disappointed anyway such a shame it could have been so much better,negative
i actually saw the evil on the big screen theres absolutely nothing scary about it seriously what where they thinking,negative
from the beginning i couldnt care less about the characters or what they were involved in i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong,negative
there was so much to make fun of in this movie i enjoyed it a lot like bad movies want a good movie not here,negative
this is my first movie review on imdb please do not see it,negative
no question about that the acting is i would say good i recommend everyone to see this movie,negative
not so here we have all seen films we enjoyed but wouldnt recommend to everyone for some reason or other,negative
quite often i think do you ever show good movies,negative
i doubt ive seen such a bad film with such good credits in a long time it could have and should have been good,negative
which is a shame all in all not a great horror film but entertaining enough,negative
they made good use of the small budget i guess i just wish the story and most of the acting was better it was too boring i can do slow movies,negative
i was very disappointed i wish people would look at his life more then his death the only thing good about this film was its soundtrack,negative
i did go to this movie with an open mind,negative
why etc etc i have been there and seen some of it,negative
the script the music just about everything in this movie is a waste of time looks and sounds much better,negative
there is no power in the performance i cant go on im sorry,negative
part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down,negative
its a nice enough kids movie maybe in the year it came out whats the point people that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago,negative
if youve seen those dont waste your time with this one all in all lame bad and not worth effort,negative
was this a comedy or was it a drama wrong,negative
now where was i actually the films not even that interesting,negative
i was really disappointed with this film she he had a hell of a lot of talent i was truly surprised as a whole i wouldnt recommend this film,negative
and plus it gave us something a bit different i think nothing of it at first i know what happens so move along and what was the point wait a minute no it wouldnt did she get around during middle school please let that be so sorry this review is so long,negative
only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie,negative
the worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terrible talk okay is it wrong to care what people think is this all the writer could come up with i wonder if something well you know and not for the right reason,negative
never mind i think anyone who is a fan of the films wanted to do this so they give it to you anyway,negative
it is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it,negative
his two annoying kids run for help this and many more scenes add nothing to the film and the worse thing about this film definitely one to avoid,negative
cheesy storyline which by the way is completely different than the original this movie is a joke dont waste your time watching this one,negative
and wonder how come this actress isnt a huge star,negative
it has very bad acting bad story lines bad characters you should never see this show if you see it on turn it off its not great you should never see it never ever ever so believe me on this ive watched it before,negative
this wasnt really a very good movie i cant say enough about this movie,negative
i wonder why a film about him has to be made,negative
i dont even know where to begin on this one its all about the family that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie although this couldnt be a horror movie even if it tried he does have some talent she has no place here im serious one of the worst movies ive ever seen ever,negative
unfortunately this is true so what whats the point of the movie whats the message behind it all,negative
you know the story well this crap is no different the acting was horrible and as all films do these days they try to get you with a twist ending which they do not,negative
i would have liked to write about the story but there wasnt any and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind a story did i already say that but thats just me,negative
i loved the running man well he didnt this is not what the book said at all i dont say it often but this film was bad note that i used someone a lot,negative
here nothing why not go and see him at his home inside the family and outside the family,negative
in the very first movie dr the result was a boring predictable movie that was not scary and not bad enough to be funny,negative
but mostly you cant hear the actors go and rent this movie,negative
s though i guess that wouldnt have been very interesting,negative
however this is also where the movie is let down,negative
i for one think we already have more than enough,negative
i was looking forward to this movie great atmosphere then first know it they almost did things i didnt get i had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense what run out of ideas,negative
they could be but i dont think its ever been tried for real i,negative
complete waste of time this movie is not comedy its not drama its not romance story it should be some turn over one end you got only one very good looking i must admit girl and thats that acting is bad dont waste your time sorry on my bad english,negative
i really wanted to like this film i was wrong this movie is a god awful waste of film and i liked the second one,negative
im not quite sure why but this movie just doesnt play the way it should,negative
so its a black comedy is it never oh all i know is it isnt funny,negative
i couldnt have been more wrong worst of all the show simply wasnt funny and i found it boring,negative
no man is an island the acting wasnt bad i dont know i just dont get it oh well,negative
so this is the movie that the next action stars were getting into and make up ones mind about a movie i mean come on dont remember dont by this movie if its on tv then yes watch it,negative
he did but something went wrong with that they should have kept james if any show needed a father it was that one,negative
i can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to end mr this is obvious from the get go believe me it isnt,negative
is it simply spent in this without any this is one of them,negative
im not sure where it all went wrong but each of those elements was wasted,negative
you watch it thinking of the film that got away,negative
who are the best people he has in mind the problem is what a waste,negative
i didnt get it but what does all this mean,negative
theres just no other way to put it points watching this,negative
i wont go through the list of shame that is his movie career whats wrong with you woman,negative
this movie looked like it was going to be really funny the plot was also pretty weak i was also really disappointed with the ending i would not recommend this movie to anyone,negative
in a bad way i mean come on really worst movie ever,negative
did i say it was boring already i was wrong,negative
so it has come to this then actually make some movies like that again the result,negative
man i just cant believe this movie no plot no acting no nothing i was watching the movie and thinking when this is going to start it never started thats it nothing else,negative
the only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film,negative
this has none of that theres a reason its there,negative
whats wrong with this film ill tell you bad plot bad jokes i know what your thinking what the hell is this as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top,negative
i mean come on the original was better and you mr,negative
it is quite simple i find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly it is truly awful,negative
if you do youll love this this film is a case in point the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me i which she had ill leave it at that,negative
that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word zombie appear in the title the acting isnt even good,negative
you watch it take a good laughs and forget it in the next half hour but this is not one of those its the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a while how can someone came up with this guy and the hero but the worst are the fighting scenes where you would think there could be something in it,negative
it happened in this film it happened in this film it happened in this film it happened in this film if it were im sure it would do well,negative
this isnt a horrible movie it just isnt that good try it maybe youll like it probably you wont,negative
i have no idea what genre this movie falls into but it certainly isnt comedy i wont say whether this is a good movie or not all i know is it is not a comedy i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone that i know or even that i dont know i am not one of them,negative
wrong no one should waste their time on this film,negative
this is by far one the most boring movies ive ever seen the movie starts of slow the storyline makes no sense at all people fighting doesnt make any sense,negative
and even if they did why anyone would want to make a movie about them,negative
it is a complete waste of money and time it was absolutely terrible it was not funny at all it was ridiculous ive seen many movies but this was absolutely the worst i just cant make up these things,negative
the plot was there one seemed to go no where dont waste your time on this one youll not miss anything,negative
story none he can actually do something you read that right,negative
its a really horrible and awful movie this was a bad bad really bad movie just please avoid it do not recommend this to no one please its just way too ridiculous makes no sense and really bad plot,negative
the music was very good that was the only thing i would recommend on seeing it,negative
did he want the sex to tell the stories or did he believe the characters would this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make,negative
what can i say what a stupid waste of time if you want to see die die ok its just bad,negative
unfortunately the film is absolutely horrible thats not to say everything about the movie is bad,negative
no matter just love your writer director but look down on it too of course not my problem,negative
it gives you something to think about but not in a good way overall i definitely didnt like this movie,negative
i have never seen the tv series or the previous movies probably thats the reason why i didnt enjoy it much,negative
they give it to you once and that should be enough,negative
it was interesting however to see it being made enjoy it for what it is,negative
no if there was ever such a thing now those kids i knew and were as realistic as it got back then and maybe now this was crap this was a low rent version of fast times and even then it didnt do much for me,negative
thats the case here its not a total waste so all in all,negative
our very first horror movie those were horror movies most sure it was that but for me this is a great movie,negative
oh why did it have to end like this it doesnt even come close,negative
in the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better,negative
the end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldnt care,negative
this film is slow this film is cheap the acting is crap the special effects are crap,negative
i kid you not this film is badly written badly acted and badly directed it does not work as action cop drama or even horror,negative
nothing special about it except for the music perhaps dont buy it,negative
it was too slow too predictable and not moving enough is great as usual but this movie is not good enough to sit through dont waste your money even the sex scenes were boring,negative
even the sex scenes are lame definitely one to avoid,negative
apparently not and who wouldnt what kind of message is that,negative
this movie is really stupid and very boring most of the time there is nothing good about this movie on any level,negative
this is the worst movie ive ever seen and i have seen lots of movies man we had lots of fun this movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen but it makes you laugh you wonder why,negative
its just that there is nothing of interest in this film,negative
didnt have the same feel that the series or the movie has i didnt enjoy it at all the so called acting was awful,negative
s s s s s s either way this is an awful movie that should have never been made,negative
it wasnt the worst episode but it wasnt that great,negative
worst movie ever it was a total waste of time and a horrible story she was so bad it was ridiculous i cant tell if it was her bad acting or because the character was just that stupid in the first place this is not the movie for you move right along its a waste of time and money,negative
a team meets death wish my favorite you can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie every single one of them what are you going to do keep watching i guess,negative
very good so should you watch it why yes of course you should,negative
with all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror but this movie is lame lame lame,negative
watch the original then you wont have to ask yourself why,negative
the worst sequel ive ever seen but still the story line is no where near as good as the first film,negative
the writing directing and editing of this tv movie for the most part was truly awful there are too many bad moments in the movie to write them all,negative
that was the only way i could sit through the whole thing,negative
this movie is bad they are terrible its not funny not funny at all i wanted to laugh i tried to laugh but this movie let me down,negative
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few movies,negative
we went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out,negative
i dont know what exactly but something has gone very wrong,negative
what a dog of a movie the real killer is the characters everything about them,negative
im very well known im not sure if the dvd is worth the money,negative
too bad this movie isnt and then and then get this,negative
the premise might even work but the writing is just terrible,negative
sorry but it just did maybe thats how they cast her,negative
our town may just have been any town just as long as you came from the right part of town that is,negative
i would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedy with a bit of mystery and suspense still i wouldnt rate this movie very high,negative
the action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little right the acting is what i like to call taking actors and making them do nothing,negative
where was i america simply is not the place to go to for action it seems especially not now,negative
new best friend is boring and the events during the movie are the same its a waste of time,negative
it was absolutely awful please i think this film is a waste of money just a big no from me,negative
there isnt too many good horror thriller sets out there,negative
some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes we think we realize what happened although theres a chance something else did,negative
this movie was absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot could have been made to work had the movie been written better the acting was some of the worst i have ever seen i was very slow and made me want to leave turn off the movie several times,negative
tries to be a comedy sorry humor is hard romance is hard this movie is like that,negative
over acting to put it simply the directing is of no help here nothing can save this non story ill give it that,negative
i thought how bad can it be still the book was better than the movie sad sad sad why even give it a star,negative
its quite good with a great star cast but i think it could have been much much better,negative
the storyline to this was just incredibly stupid and pretty easy to make what a waste none of the actors were really any good at it,negative
this scene is probably the best out of the entire movie some good parts though,negative
i love movies and ill watch any movie all the way through just to give it a chance i can finally say that i found a movie i cant watch all the way through the long scenes of just and this movie is three hours long so,negative
to think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this the horror the horror oh can it be there is exactly one surprise in the entire movie both live look make a wish then another then more and more,negative
so what was the movie all about the predictable stuff happens the special effects are not bad but nothing special,negative
the actors are really poor this film has no comedy and it could have been so funny no action and no horror and it could have had so much of both the quality overall is poor,negative
there are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie that was cool but okay we got it move on please,negative
no just no thats all that needs to be said the next great thriller seriously you cant say it has bad acting because there is no acting you cant say it has bad writing because it has no writing you cant say it has bad cinematography because there is no cinematography you cant say its a bad movie because there is no movie if you dont believe me go watch it,negative
the movie isnt all bad just mostly he deserves it hes not that good it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters,negative
a movie but thats all ill say about that it really looked like she was acting,negative
the movie is entertaining and it had a fine cast,negative
until than the killer had only killed women oh well i guess it wasnt as predictable as i thought,negative
action suspense no please dont its terrible truly truly terrible go see it,negative
this movie is one of the worst films i have seen yes no was there a plot no no,negative
wonderful acting characters this happens at least three other times in the movie thats what i went to see right thats right oh they try you heard me what,negative
i thought i had seen bad but this is it,negative
dont waste your time or money on this film the acting is bad the story is just one of the worst i have come across and the script was just awful nothing about it was good you end up thinking to yourself why am i watching this crap is all i can say,negative
this movie is one of them or maybe like i said before i just didnt get it,negative
a a i gave get out of my room a three out of ten im pretty certain that the stars look at material like this today and wonder what they were thinking,negative
the editing didnt help this mess at all its a shame he didnt have more screen time like that and indeed their characters get lost in this film,negative
what may help someone about to see the movie is to realize that it is not supposed to be scary,negative
no more no less what was he thinking of there is one good thing though shame they couldnt think of anything to put in front of it,negative
this movie was awful if one wants to see that side of her one can just rent one of her movies,negative
the end result all three were used one after another after another,negative
this is what happens when you live in a small country with very little next to none even cinema history,negative
i will give it a second chance but was very disappointed in the first one,negative
get this oh come on what then why do they sound like that t starts to happen so oh hes not such a emotional zombie after all finally finally and feels nothing thats deep no no,negative
i quite like the fact the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time that might be the right thing to do but one may not like that anyway,negative
i mean its so cool it could have been better though,negative
what a waste of time and money other times he was simply a zombie too bad they didnt use them in the movie it would have been better,negative
what was the point of the boy not talking another power the boy has or what what happened to the dog,negative
it has to be the worst horror flick either of us had ever seen,negative
you wont believe your eyes i know what youre thinking great cast i know and it was the worst great cast film ive ever seen,negative
but the film itself is shot completely wrong but it isnt the performances are okay given the awful script,negative
it is terrible the story is so dumb you can say there isnt one,negative
believe me it feels like an awful long time before they do,negative
how do i begin this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack im pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place,negative
i watched this movie so that you dont have to the making of feature was far more interesting than the movie itself,negative
the acting itself was ok from all the actors but,negative
until this episode was it the writing was it the directing well probably never know,negative
for that reason alone i am writing this imdb the film is absolutely awful even for a b movie,negative
they may be right im not sure thats all and that was really the main problem for me,negative
that in itself sounds boring im a great fan of war films if they are done well in fact the film would have worked much better if he had,negative
lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes better yet get over it,negative
this movie had very little good points the special effects and acting was horrible for sure,negative
as one review said it was like watching a high school play and,negative
i must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time if a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first,negative
this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen it has no good features at all,negative
please do not waste hours of your life watching this movie the acting was horrible too,negative
this film is really terrible special effects are so terrible,negative
t he is supposed to be a real hilarious cut up figure again,negative
very predictable plot not an original idea in this whole film,negative
this is the worst show i have seen in years i believe that it should be taken off of t,negative
i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself am i going crazy cant i see the beauty from a film like this am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out i dont know it did but no and boy some of those ideas were stupid no the rest nothing i think to myself again maybe i am the crazy one dont waste your time with this,negative
possibly the worst movie i ever saw you cant see anything in this movie it is way to dark so you still cant see low budget movies can be done so much better then this the only good thing about this movie being so dark is that you cant see the awful acting,negative
the rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time and,negative
the events in this movie are not even close to the truth dont even waste your time watching this for free save your time and money by not watching this movie,negative
still there are some nice scenes in this movie anyway can you believe that never run out of it where do they get this stuff really who think up this crap,negative
and people still didnt watch it the fight scenes were definitely what this movie was all about in the end this was not a great movie but i wasnt expecting a great movie a great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movies,negative
lots of wasted talent dont waste your time just awful,negative
well here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isnt even being much of a zombie movie still its not a completely horrible movie its a rather good looking one or rather said the movie at least doesnt have a cheap look over it,negative
its the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made,negative
not here no way bad enough oh no not the case here its just bad editing its annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie then after one of them the movie is over it was better than the whole film simply put avoid,negative
but imdb wants me to have more lines it was kind of pretty it would be a far better use of your time time that you will never get back,negative
saw this movie last night this movie was bad bad bad,negative
this is simply put the worst movie i have ever seen you know to laugh at and make fun of no we think oh its just the beginning,negative
already at the beginning of each scene you know what the joke will be about,negative
one star thats all this documentary deserves i havent felt this disappointed in watching a movie let alone a documentary in quite some time what were you thinking it doesnt even look like it was taken seriously,negative
although there is no right way to play his plays there is most certainly great acting good acting and bad acting while mr his direction has always been better than his acting is it worth seeing certainly,negative
just leave it running in the background well i wonder,negative
you couldnt call it acting they just made up a bunch of crap no of course not and dark that really wasnt a happy ending was it she couldnt do it me its all about me,negative
i see no reason she cannot take this experience and somehow turn it into a career in some way not even a little bit a woman is killed in the beginning for no reason,negative
it really is that bad i couldnt think of any other reason why this film would be made,negative
youll never look at your dog the same way again fantastic,negative
strong plot scary moments good acting while others are just,negative
really there is nothing much else to say about it,negative
but lets face it the lines arent really important wasnt he dead,negative
because the film is very different from the book you are better off not seeing it,negative
this is without a doubt the most hilarious movie ive ever seen,negative
however if youve never seen one dont start with this one so why was it so annoying annoying,negative
you dont know these people so youll probably find it as dull and stupid as i did then try again,negative
what i have absolutely no idea and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea the child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this,negative
i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone even the very young,negative
bad move if you watch it any other way let me recommend something to you dont,negative
the murder scenes and lets face it thats what this genre is all about arent interesting,negative
this really was the worst movie i have ever seen really really boring i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good i could not tell at all that they were in love,negative
this is in this viewers opinion an awful movie if you have time on your hands it is still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie,negative
clearly not his best film but by no means his worst,negative
well i must say this is probably the worst film i have seen this year with this great cast i at least expected some good acting but i didnt even get that,negative
i was somewhat disappointed with this film not even close and as for the girls dont expect much there either what do we see that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film it isnt a horrible film in any way it just has nothing going for it either,negative
because hes black i didnt buy it for a minute,negative
do not waste your money on this movie the end,negative
this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen who is he guess,negative
but im really surprised myself to say that this was worst than rock on,negative
though i hear hes moving to tv good for him i keep thinking up ways to make this movie better,negative
i couldnt believe my eyes once ive watched this movie theres no point in it either then blood and violence dont even waste your time with it this is probably the worst horror film i have ever watched out of all the horror films i ever saw,negative
anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since it really wasnt good at all,negative
the story as i understand is based on real events well it is that in a way but why go on,negative
not much happens in this film eventually the movie ends i still dont know,negative
if you liked the first two films then im sorry to say youre not going to like this one pretty poor,negative
i have never seen a movie as bad as this it is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is not funny,negative
everything seems so forced anything we wont forget as soon as next shot goes on was that the close for that shot or what please you just need to fire the writer of this stupid show,negative
have i called this movie that yet i just wanted to be sure ill close on that note,negative
i dont understand why did i watch it i really dont get the point of this show despite of trying people are saying that sex and the city is funny in what way give me a break the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every relationship if you can have a good sex youre a good husband or wife and yes,negative
unfortunately that did not happen that is the best i can say about it seriously i did not laugh even once watching this film however he does what he can with his character,negative
call girl is better than water at least from the story telling point of view,negative
this movie does not show what absolutely perfectly happened during these times quite boring i would rather watch play school so i would definitely like to never ever see this movie again in my whole life,negative
the movie was terrible easily the worst movie i have seen in the past few years one of those movies i will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie i can think of dont see this movie,negative
enjoy sure i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer but thats not the point,negative
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen what i got was nothing its just ridiculous,negative
i have seen a lot of movies but this is certainly one of the worst ever a is possible or not perhaps it isnt but even than this could have been a good movie and whats wrong about the script you probably ask yourself very good money,negative
would have been a good short maybe even powerful why because they had no script not too many i wonder why that is not too many why is that,negative
i didnt really expect a movie masterpiece but unfortunately this is not even decent action,negative
lets cut this short this is the masterpiece of s t,negative
this ones a real one this is history bad history,negative
more good films will come so long as more films like these dont get made,negative
i think ill just read the book and see how i get on,negative
is completely wasted most of all it isnt even fun,negative
i really thought this would be a good movie boy,negative
first of all it was made second of all people went to see it,negative
i found it extremely boring funny i dont remember the sex scene,negative
but they were also good movies ok sure it made no sense at all that was the best part of the movie for me,negative
they used a lot of his stories for low budget films way back when but they still come off today as good serious entertainment i,negative
it tries also to be a musical yes we get the message these scenes are just strange and very very long but nothing in these scenes points towards any kind of reality,negative
the horror is that there is not one good line not one good joke and only one bad thing the making of this movie,negative
what is wrong with this film there wasnt a single scary moment in the entire film and there wasnt a single original moment in the film either it must have seen a few horror movies too,negative
this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen it is not funny it is not interesting and should not have been made,negative
well then i wasnt too sure about which one i wanted to review first those were better than this and that doesnt say much theres nothing good here well the gore was decent very average cinematography the acting is extremely poor been done before plenty of times stupid story just stupid simply terrible worse than you might imagine now those movies are crap you can enjoy wait check that dont watch it its crap,negative
you dont like the characters very much you just hate one of them,negative
this is not because they want to but because they have to who knows look why,negative
it must be true it could happen i guess the end of the picture he doesnt even make it to the beginning of the picture,negative
isnt it so no big deal for you do you need anything more than this enough is enough why they have no other work to do all are good looking oh go instead have some more such entertainment,negative
i found it done very well done the performances from the cast was not bad but it wasnt good either it was not made for the entire family this is certainly just for kids,negative
it does not make sense to you well it doesnt have to i know mr,negative
this show is the worst show ever terrible acting terrible script terrible series,negative
why the script doesnt give him much dialogue the second act where the main action takes place is too little too late,negative
i think they could have done a little better there even if the budget was low and im sure it was but still,negative
original this is a great film if you like b movies,negative
no one in this movie has very much to do,negative
either that or he is simply bad for those who havent read the book yet i recommend just reading that,negative
the story is even worse than the action scenes a low budget maybe when that happens the result is really bad,negative
a should i even ask that question never actually do they live do they die will you care,negative
i must admit i found it pretty decent until i started to think about what the characters were saying dont you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer i could go on and on and on however,negative
nothing about this movie is any good i enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors nothing good to say about this movie the title says it all,negative
action movies should have action and dramatic moments should have drama,negative
okay i still love him her but think a little less,negative
there just isnt a lot to say about it hes not one i would think of to play this kind of role but hes fine with it hes a fine actor anyway everything including the cinematography is okay but not memorable that was a surprise ive never seen the film called that dont believe it,negative
yes evil it wouldnt have happened period especially in time of war,negative
really wrong come on guys what where they thinking it happened to me too once really i could go on hours with this stuff dont watch it,negative
this movie was one of the most boring horror movies i have seen in a long time and i have seen a lot i can get movies for free and i still didnt think it was worth the time to get,negative
get on with the film avoid this movie it is a waste of your money,negative
im sorry to everyone who loved his work but i unfortunately did not,negative
who knows except those involved do we need to know,negative
i liked those movies this is just a bad movie,negative
really really in this so called show is totally beyond me,negative
apparently they were right please save your money and time for another movie,negative
why do i watch movies like this and that was about it,negative
if they sound good to me they will sound good to the audience i am going to use all of them i havent an idea who they are they made it up with my first and second point it is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that its good it is just bad dont watch this,negative
i am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this but come on,negative
i didnt like this movie to me it didnt make much sense i also didnt think it was scary there is just nothing special about it,negative
thats just lame did they not watch this mess thats just wrong,negative
no never mind i felt sad for the rest of the actors,negative
i made myself watch it until the end even though i had absolutely no interest in the plot if there was one the ending was even worse than the rest of the film,negative
and on top of that this is a very boring film,negative
its such a sure fire way to make a classic film my favorite scene,negative
so i had thought to myself what could go wrong here is the story basically it should have those ideas in it they show up do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story not that the movie doesnt have its moments but thats all other than that its not really a good movie not for people who care about plot and character and story telling,negative
i like to think i have seen it all and so on,negative
who would have thought it ask yourself this then and then there are a couple of good things but other than this there really is nothing to recommend it,negative
then for several years i heard absolutely nothing bad idea move on you guys please,negative
that is if you want to call this a story all in all i would give it a one laugh,negative
this is not to say that the film isnt worth watching no problem its truly funny,negative
this movie was awful or at least not by the people who were involved with this movie it would be a good movie to kill yourself too everyone will understand why,negative
time to watch something that actually is about real problems,negative
who would you want to be with i enjoyed it how the romance started is a mystery to me they never said anything to each other anyway so i dont understand how they got together oh what a come on for a long time really hard,negative
some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen and i understand where theyre coming from but i really have seen worse was that too much to ask for well apparently that was too much to ask for stay away from this movie,negative
s theres nothing wrong with the performances thats about it if so my bad yes the direction is no help either why go on want to see a better example of this kind of movie i,negative
this was not a well done western what is the point of this film this was a waste of film,negative
of course she falls down this gives her we always knew it could come back her father says right as i said its been a few years didnt i,negative
i cant think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects,negative
this is the world this movie is set in i liked it,negative
nothing that is going to bring you back and nothing to buy on its own,negative
i liked half life i am still its fan why but not this,negative
the movie was ok not bad not good just ok,negative
another annoying problem this movie had was the means to an end writing style,negative
i dont remember much of the plot and i think thats because there wasnt much of one to remember,negative
one of the worst movies ive ever seen the plot does completely stupid things at times,negative
what a waste of time and money whats with them,negative
i dont care who the actors are this movie is just horrible i actually dont know why my family is still watching it oh wait yes i do,negative
i am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits,negative
do not pay to rent this but that being said still this movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
this movie was terrible thats just terrible and finally i dont know maybe a baby is in there,negative
after being a big fan of the ten minute t unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed,negative
i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them,negative
the movie was bad why was this made into a movie was it an action comedy i dont remember any laughs,negative
this movie has it all not that anyone would find most of those funny to begin with i dont think i need to point out which one but then again im sure there are other scenes that will give people this same feeling this is indeed a terrible movie,negative
i would list this film under the horror film genre it is that bad how dumb,negative
but the movie was a let down the characters just did not seem too real it just did not work,negative
bad acting bad story predictable simple bad acting bad story predictable simple bad acting bad story predictable simple,negative
one reason her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes but so what,negative
the horror you do not come to mind is no of course they do not want we kill you all and so on,negative
ive heard her re tell them many times it looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera no this is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie,negative
unfortunately it has no plot this movie had none there isnt one,negative
the ending made no sense some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them,negative
its so bad that it could just not have been any worse this is the worst movie ever,negative
its really not no other then that it got pretty stupid she was so bad the problem with this movie was the ending and the over all movie was just stupid the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off,negative
slow and boring horror movie the premise is obvious and has been done to death already,negative
without her this would be no more than a cheap kids movie but at least she does add an air of quality,negative
this thing was bad really bad i found nothing good in it and i did try,negative
overall i simply found this to be a second rate movie out of,negative
when i watched this film i had absolutely no idea what was going on im telling you that was an hour and a half of my life i wont get back,negative
its hard to believe a movie can be this bad but you live and learn,negative
not much music in this one but what there is i liked although none are memorable what what,negative
film at least mr its the only thing about this movie thats worth anything,negative
but this has got to be the worst ive seen its not even funny i find nothing good to say about this movie,negative
why i look back on it and realize there was not one funny thing in the whole movie,negative
there is nothing good or entertaining about this movie about this movie who knows some have a plot some dont but theyre all about as bad as this one thats all this movie is well why not,negative
the rest of the time i couldnt make out anything,negative
the first episode of this new show was on today and it was horrible,negative
of course not was this movie anything special of course not top dont watch this,negative
he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his head,negative
this is hands down the worst film ive ever seen,negative
however if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you wont be disappointed,negative
but i dont know if i can so which is cool i guess,negative
before i knew it the film was over thats the movie,negative
its a bad very bad movie well for people a real realistic movie is a good thing for me it is not maybe thats the reason for people say that this film is real oh,negative
the acting by the actors is fairly good the movie is filmed fairly good as well same thing goes for the music the film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end,negative
horrible all i can say is that is movie was horrible i came to watch this movie half expecting some good acting all i got was a horrible movie,negative
or read the book and see what could have been,negative
oh god who did this script anyway who did this cast,negative
but it is a sequel and a story has to come up he has a daughter very important for the story funny yes just like the rest of the film it is just too funny to tell youll see that this movie is a waste of time so do not watch it,negative
little things like that as bad as that is it might have worked stop it lets hope not why was this film made in the first place,negative
ive seen many a b movie some would no doubt way yes well i hate big budget movies so i say no great this isnt exactly easy on second thought ill make it easy i dont know its not important and that b movie fans is really saying something,negative
how many times can i say awful i dont know what to say just terrible the best thing about the movie,negative
etc and when the end comes boy does it come quickly,negative
the movie ends i dont mind a bad horror movie but i really hate a dull bad horror movie which this definitely is,negative
this must be the most boring film i ever saw,negative
this film was and she says yes the acting was terrible to say the least the sex scene was weak but we got to see her which was okay,negative
this is a stupid movie all of them are there are just so many parts to this film that make absolutely no sense now what was that like i said this is good for a laugh one time but dont watch it again,negative
and i love it the plot i couldnt really ever figure out what he had to do with the story except everyone had to hate the man back then and you couldnt make a movie without one,negative
the film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour well i can tell you it will not come am i living in the same world he lives in,negative
this movie was terrible i thought with all the some what decent actors it would be better dont waste your time,negative
oh man i want to stop talking about her now,negative
very slow please dont watch this movie it is that bad ten lines is a lot so i dont know what else to say,negative
good if you want a good laugh but not good enough to actually look for,negative
i should live this film but i dont the problem is that it is boring well it isnt the first time this kind of film has been made,negative
some parts were silly and some parts were lame but overall the movie was worth watching,negative
however it is not a bad film i dont want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out i think this is a good family film though overall,negative
thats it thats the entire movie there may have been some dialogue here and there but nothing comes to mind,negative
the movie has no sense at all nothing makes sense in this movie,negative
actually nothing happens and this gets so boring after a while,negative
this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen i would think you could get that from the title i cant even remember why i saw this film or when only that is an absolutely horrible movie viewing experience,negative
acting performance worst than storyline feel bad for the films that lost to this crap acting performance worst than storyline feel bad for the films that lost to this crap,negative
i completely understand why this movie was made what i dont understand is why this movie was made the film is absolutely horrible,negative
this movie should have never been made what a shame of the budget almost hilarious and that is a shame for an action movie definitely not worth watching,negative
usually the twist at the end makes the episode great this one killed it,negative
this was so far the worst movie i have seen in my entire life and i have seen some really bad movies little did i know that the cover would be the best part of the movie where to start if you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy otherwise when you see this movie run,negative
dont waste your time and money read the book instead its really worth it,negative
absolutely one of the worst movies of the year but shes dead etc am i right guys,negative
in a perfect world yes yet this one is even worse,negative
lets put it this way i actually get this movie that was what the writer director was going for it had all of the same features its script worked this movie is not too bad it didnt work,negative
reality is not one of its strong points but then at times we all need to have money i wish i could say give me back my money,negative
so it was a surprise to see that the director and writer are the one and same person,negative
they couldnt tell a good joke to save their lives lets hope this mr in fact its even a waste of time to write anything about this crap thats why ill stop right now and rather watch a good film,negative
it is all in the camera thats what you at least expect,negative
but there can be too much of a good thing lots of people die i dont know why i wish it had had a few jokes,negative
this my friends is one of the worst tv movies ive ever seen the movie is too long and very boring avoid this tv movie it is not worth your time,negative
mr this is nothing more than a home movie and a really bad one as well,negative
the acting is poor but the animation and music is pretty good however if you have the chance to see the film for free do so then you wont have to waste money,negative
this has to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen some of you people actually like this movie what a stupid movie,negative
nothing to watch here its all been done and better before,negative
of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst they are making a sequel so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie but i dont think it is possible,negative
but they sure didnt act like they even seen a zombie before second the characters are pretty badly written how stupid is that,negative
can you believe this was based on a book others must have needed the work real well two stars now theyre funny,negative
this horrible it looks as if it was filmed with a video camera,negative
sometimes its just not worth going know what i mean and much better also,negative
as far as this movie but no its not to be and the ending however the rest of the movie is left to be say it with me,negative
perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song,negative
there was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before and more than one person lost their head in the situation,negative
what the everything is ok but i didnt i mean never mind what were we talking about why are you at me what were we talking about what are you doing here oh never mind leave the island already and take me with you can you hear me now he looked so surprised what the oh i think something bad is about to happen can you hear me now i think something bad is about to happen,negative
about the only good thing about this is the setting,negative
its horrible our made up movie had a better plot than this piece,negative
however even if this movie had been all jokes that would still leave us with thats not even funny thats just boring the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like theyre supposed to be funny,negative
the title of the movie is awful the actors are awful and the little girl there was a story here they took it out there is no story in one way also this movie was perfect well this is the case here a perfect crap,negative
theres not that much to say in the end one would have expect much more from a director who made way better movies in the past in a word its boring,negative
this movie is too stupid for words well than youll have a chance,negative
but maybe i wont this is not even a b movie its a made for tv b movie,negative
again its just as well if only she was in more scenes,negative
because you do know these people but that is a different story and dont even get me started there,negative
it was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place since that time we rate movies based on kill or be killed as the worst movie of all time it isnt worth a second look thats for sure sorry,negative
so we did this movie did nothing to change my mind,negative
the score is horrible its one of the worst movies ive ever seen and thats something to say,negative
here its brought up its in the book but there is a reason totally left out of the movie it is bad but i watched the whole thing and it is in a silly sort of way a lot of fun,negative
do not rent it alone as you will not enjoy the experience,negative
however the plot is very similar to the original home alone film,negative
i cant really figure out who the main character is since the one female who lives at the end is not really in the movie all that much you have to see this film to believe it since there are some pretty great death scenes does that kill the guy i cant remember it did have a bad start and got better but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level,negative
the writer director of this film obviously doesnt know anything about film keep your day job,negative
the end of the movie turns into a good drama since the first half of the film really had no point the way the scene is shot is beautiful,negative
this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen and how did it end,negative
as to the film itself the dialogue oh the dialogue,negative
i cant believe they even released such a movie the only good acting came from the water in the movie this has to be one of worst if not the worst movie i have ever seen the storyline and if you can call it the plot of the movie seems to have been written by an high school kid,negative
i wonder how that one got by the shows writers your dog is ill so go have sex youll feel better,negative
this movie was pretty poor the main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother people die the ending is pretty poor an unfortunately boring movie its true sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie,negative
anyone just as i thought you actually feel that this movie is way too long and special effects are not so special by the way and its like that in this case it just doesnt work in this case there is no quality at all yes it is dont waste your time and dont waste your money too stay home read a book,negative
now whats wrong with the actors that took part in that crap liked him there nothing and thats what we get the story is a very bad joke,negative
the word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used lets look at the problems in direction script,negative
this must rate with the worst films i have ever seen it just wasnt funny,negative
you wouldnt leave him alone with your daughter no matter her age something creepy would happen the movies look is quite boring,negative
i just dont have enough bad things to say about this film it couldnt have been cheap either with all the stars that were in it plus all those special effects and fire scenes,negative
maybe it would have worked better as a short film,negative
well this is actually the worst film ive ever seen and ive seen a great deal of bad movies its just not even worth seeing for free on tv,negative
the music and the girls are great unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them it was weak very very weak,negative
lot of dance and music but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time and time to time its look really good but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting,negative
and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes,negative
this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen without a doubt,negative
i watched this with my children my little ones would watch it every day my kids now hate this dumb movie,negative
really when making a movie you dont need an ending so make friends,negative
the gore well its here but not as much as one would hope or expect,negative
man what were they thinking but this is awful awful awful awful awful awful,negative
really what to the people behind this movie think about that title what do they mean then they went off to war all of them why did they do this how you ask you still ask i just said i dont know but there you can also find it on the back of the dvd cover the actual movie wont tell you anything else well that sounds pretty much like a waste of time right fans will check this out or have already,negative
where to start shes not even acting the other actors were fine but certainly nothing special except the old guy he was pretty good very original,negative
i was thinking about that s in any case the original is so much better,negative
unless i hope so because at least that idea is funny,negative
im sorry but this is such a bad movie its hilarious what the hell please i dont see how anyone can even take this film seriously,negative
this is also my first review so you can tell i must hate this film at lot dont get me wrong i like my serious films but this was awful why the main character has nothing to recommend him best place for him and i thought that was about the only good scene or maybe that was because it was so close the final credits happens all the time in really bad films that is awful,negative
im not saying all these shows are bad but they arent good either but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this now okay,negative
what is wrong with these people who would pay money to make this most bad films are funny because they are crap watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self we dont need you,negative
my brother once forced me to watch this film because he said i wouldnt believe how bad a film can get he was right,negative
this is a good action movie but thats about it strange these are just some of the things that show just a lack of thought put into the story telling,negative
its not even a supposed so bad its good movie,negative
but that didnt help about half way through we turned it off,negative
the humor is never funny but this movie is not it,negative
this movie has some of the worst acting ive ever seen,negative
this started with a bad premise and then just got worse ive watched a lot of movies including some i didnt care for,negative
well i though that this movie would be a lot like that,negative
who should have told him and when the story just doesnt work that way otherwise i certainly wouldnt care,negative
was it his wife his girlfriend his would be girlfriend her father who knows who knows,negative
the only bit that was worth it was the ending those who have seen the film will know what i mean this could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched,negative
i was wrong this can still work for a lead character if you do it well this wasnt done well how come a friend family what it wasnt made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another not to mention the running itself,negative
and thats about all that is this thing is slow those were rather off too bad special effects just one that i can think of,negative
this an extremely horrible movie and if your thinking youve seen another horrible movie exactly like this one before you probably have in fact that is probably all that the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent movie which will never work,negative
well thats what these guys thought anyway but i highly doubt it,negative
this movie is not worth anything never watch this movie at least it is better then the movie,negative
its not as bad as some would have you believe,negative
thats it dont rent it the other reviews are right it is awful the cast is awful the direction is awful and the script is awful,negative
bad bad bad story telling i do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie even the soundtrack was good but in this one oh my good for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director watch it if you have nothing better to do,negative
i feel sorry for the poor actors in this movie two stars,negative
the acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good,negative
first of all the genre of this movie isnt comedy its more of a drama as some of the other reviews point out there are some nice music in the movie,negative
the real story of his life would of been more interesting oh boy not true now the acting was very good i like her though but not in this flick,negative
however this movie is truly awful then there is the dialogue very poor indeed much has been made of the special effects in this movie,negative
this movie was not that good at all that music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie well thats all i really have on that,negative
but there are some movies i liked really the film is still going on in my back but the few effects are really not enough to watch the whole time,negative
this show is terrible and if its not part of the scene the actors will tell them that its wrong,negative
lets think about that for just a moment its just stupid well you are the ones that need to open your eyes,negative
the jokes are not funny at all there is nothing funny about that is it even supposed to be joke,negative
it could have been good it was a complete waste of time,negative
where do i start they were pretty awful there simply arent words for how bad this was,negative
they are almost all movies that my wife made me watch ok lets say we can get past that,negative
the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top,negative
like i said this movie could have but did not dont waste your money on this movie,negative
yes said title line does actually appear in this movie why im not sure and so we begin the movie there is almost no character development at all thats fine you dont expect a whole lot enough said yes and no so what about the gore theres some thats really about it,negative
it has action but not very good action i didnt enjoy watching it and i would never ever watch this again,negative
the whole production work on the show seemed too low budget for what was on tv at the time,negative
lets do it the film is a series of these scenes but it was none of these much more,negative
the only good thing about this movie is the cast imagine a bad movie,negative
what a bad movie the premise was all there the actors were all there,negative
the worst movie i have ever seen but this turned out to be even worse the audience isnt involved and that is not all,negative
there isnt really too much to talk about in the movie,negative
this is perhaps the most ridiculous crap i have ever watched i need to use up a few more lines apparently so may as well mention some more stupid things about the film,negative
i have to say that the opening credits were a let down do i give it another chance and watch again four out of ten and no more sorry,negative
i say this if you want to see a movie you go to a theater,negative
we have an average family when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad remember not thats it not really but its still a good show for kids,negative
i knew it all along not this flick though no stars for down on us,negative
what can i say about this film other than dont see it what are they doing possibly its just hard to tell,negative
this movie it was horrible i am a huge fan of horror movies and most of the time horror movies other people say are bad i like but this plot was awful it made no sense if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway please do,negative
in the end we dont really care as much about them as we should its a shame that this wasnt what it could have been,negative
then again what do i know im only a child,negative
the soundtrack the so called plot and each and every actor over and over again oh my god,negative
terrible movie what a waste of time the only good thing i can say about the movie is wait wait there is nothing good i can say about it,negative
but this is still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough you simply wont enjoy it for others and fans of gore i say give it a shot,negative
another try another miss i mean nothing could save it bad i want my money back,negative
what a waste of time im not sure how this got made in fact,negative
other than that this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it,negative
he also happens to be the best friend of the films hero,negative
but for what thats all any type of movie making is,negative
i wanted to like it i really did i tried very very hard to like it and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film,negative
this movie was not just bad as in low budget badly acted etc although it certainly was all of those things what i want to know is is this supposed to be a horror movie its just annoying,negative
if you have ever heard of these comic book characters you know what to expect fantastic,negative
fact this is a great example of that its seriously weak and thats when they dont say anything live with it,negative
well and why not sure theyre cheap this isnt art its entertainment this one was shot in five days and look at the cast the special effects arent very special,negative
the movie was awful apparently the director does not know either because he never told us,negative
ive never saw the first three but i know theyre all better than this is it makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie,negative
everything just makes you go what havent i seen this before,negative
in any case it makes little or no sense period nothing in this film is original except for the end not everything is exactly in that order,negative
ok not i add when it was shown on screen not that id know thats about all i can say really,negative
i really cant say enough bad things about this movie,negative
but not much not in this country the cinematography is poor,negative
in fact there is not much acting going on in this movie at all,negative
no its not done like that you always fight fire from as low as possible ill give it a point for this,negative
this movie is another reason its a tv movie why was this movie even made there is nothing wrong with the acting its all in the script its just not that funny people need to think before they write stuff like this,negative
i cant begin to tell you how bad this is theres no sense or suspense there are a few good songs but thats about it,negative
this might be the worst film ever made and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone and dont even get me started on the plot its truly that bad,negative
this movie is terrible and so are the actors the movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever im sure that i could make a better movie with my friends,negative
running is what i should have done i try to help out but enough is enough please,negative
he also lost a lot of good friends during his life,negative
what a shame what a terrible shame and then well nothing really it could have been great ok maybe not great but it could have been very good,negative
total waste of time and money the movie was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to have left it that way,negative
ill make this short and to the point the actors well its the best they can do the script which brings me to this,negative
if you dont like stupid b action movies this is not for you,negative
after coming of the great work of being there a year earlier how i mean how can he make this and how did this thing even get made,negative
but i didnt think much of this movie worst of all was the story which didnt make sense at all youre going to anyway i didnt hate it its just not very good,negative
this movie has got to be the worse movie i have ever seen this movie isnt even good for laughs bad bad movie,negative
why did they make this film watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad that one i can recommend,negative
i dont know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show,negative
and no it just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay,negative
does anything at all happen in this movie well i was after watching this crap,negative
some may say the camera work was great the action a first for its time,negative
this is a way out film and not very good at all,negative
for the money yes ill say it bad acting save your money,negative
my life cannot go on my brother was close by save yourself unless your up for a good laugh all in all just not a good flick,negative
this film is fantastic the whole thing is badly done watch it for the script though,negative
i am not sure i could have been more disappointed this had it all weak dialogue weak performances you name it i was let down,negative
first of all she has had her moments but overall she just usually doesnt take off in any one performance i think hes got action star in his blood,negative
first of all i really cant understand how some people enjoyed this movie its the worst thing i have ever seen and i think that says it all this thing,negative
however the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie what else ive never liked this show and i never will,negative
at all it didnt at the least give you a serious talking to,negative
this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen you really hate it i guess not,negative
and this was a true story only later i found out it was a made for tv movie oh well,negative
i was wrong this could have been so much better,negative
so this year was no different here they are where was the joke did they make any sense to anyone how old is this guy and how old does he think he is,negative
terrible i just couldnt believe how bad this movie is,negative
and she might as well have been and the running scene at the end how silly can you get its too bad,negative
i have read several reviews that ask the question why was this film made so why was this film made why the world may never know i wanted to feel for these guys overall i must ask the question again why was this film made,negative
the only thing i have to say is when is this going to end dont waste your time of money on this piece of crap,negative
i still dont know what the point of this terrible film was,negative
not the best not far from being the worst guess what,negative
and on and on it goes now that was funny,negative
absolutely the most boring movie i have ever spent my money on boring boring boring no acting talent shown just reading a part,negative
fast forward to the future no movie should take that long,negative
the title doesnt make much sense to me back to the present day,negative
all in all a nice movie but it has been done more than once the going back to the past part which is good,negative
a film that is more than bad everything about it is bad yes its that bad what would you do not this guy enough said,negative
its the end of the world it was cheap that sort of stuff there was a lot of that in this movie,negative
this is almost the worst film you will ever see the plot is predictable,negative
t a looking for it theyre so bad they make this one look like a classic,negative
their performances were okay i guess you either will like it or you wont,negative
they have to be two of my favorite shows on tv i mean maybe one special episode but an entire series is just dumb,negative
its nothing but footage from the first film my god,negative
i doubt you will care it doesnt feel like it,negative
and a bad one at that i have no idea only time will tell,negative
i just expected a bit more in my opinion this is the worst out of the three,negative
this series is not everything its worked up to be,negative
but this movie was a total waste of effort seriously,negative
i was looking forward to this flick i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much you got some gore but everything else was just pretty life less as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie or oh well,negative
guess that means i only watched the beginning and the end,negative
its not like i was expecting a good film this did not even do that since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap s s s,negative
all the action scenes were stupid if you havent seen this film dont waste your time,negative
what were they thinking when they made this truly terrible film,negative
the death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there,negative
there is nothing good about this movie dont waste your time watching this movie and its the same old story man plays god,negative
this was an awful movie not that you would expect that but its just more of the problem,negative
i did not watch the entire movie i could not watch the entire movie but it isnt dont watch it,negative
it was probably just my dvd but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd,negative
here we go and why ok beautiful scenes but whats the point of that you will know what i mean dont watch this movie its a waste of time,negative
its just a sad example of money wasted by hollywood and now i waste my time even thinking about it,negative
and there were not many of them it tries to be more than it really is and in this case that is a bad thing why and what happened to the other characters from the video game,negative
i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting,negative
an interesting change from the first one there was more mystery to this movie then the first all up the movie is enjoyable,negative
but i will leave it at that its not that big a deal you know,negative
this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw the beginning is somewhat good but the end i still dont even get it the acting is somewhat not so bad but some place i could do better for sure,negative
i knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once,negative
every time i thought oh this is the final scene the final shot i got one more what does that bring to the story he just didnt its never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be the more power to them but this just made no sense,negative
nothing well isnt that original so is the film itself,negative
not realistic at all i wonder if it made any money if that was the case then it was a great movie,negative
this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen it has no good features at all,negative
special effects that looked like something that a little child would create,negative
this is one of the worst movies ive seen in my life,negative
ending up was sad it doesnt make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man,negative
i could go on and on on how this is a bad movie,negative
beyond that i found little of interest in the rest of the movie i just didnt care about what was going on three name actors and not a good performance between them i couldnt tell what was going on,negative
not me but its not over yet and its time to hit play again maybe something great happens before the end sorry,negative
well awful is just the first name even if they were not such bad actors they wouldnt have been able to save the scene man this is great cinematography i will remember this scene for the rest of my life i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie now this is getting fun well done its a comedy remember okay its a comedy i got that and i can live with that unfortunately it is none of those,negative
the special effects arent terrible but are not the best looking the acting was absolutely terrible and looked bad they just could not act to save their lives if you want a great laugh watch this otherwise you should really avoid this day,negative
the script is horrible the acting is horrible the direction is horrible what not at all,negative
the problem i had was that was all they did there was no plot at all to this movie or i just didnt see it i just needed something and all that there was was a bunch of love making scenes not thats it was bad or anything i just wanted more things to happen in the movie anything i wonder what happened,negative
i actually saw the movie before i read the book then i read the book and loved it do not watch this movie unless you need to waste money,negative
there was no plot it was very annoying its a ridiculous plot,negative
typical thriller has been done many times before this is beyond predictable it doesnt even try to make you guess the plot is the plot and theres no thinking outside the box here theres not really anything to say about this film its not particularly bad but theres no good points either i have no feeling towards this film its as if i never even watched it,negative
this movie is a bad movie i love that scene but the movie is a very bad movie,negative
here are the problems i had with the film im disappointed,negative
we never really believe the words she says but the film never does and you cant,negative
there were very few good moments in this film what happened to her is she better now what happened to her overall this is not a good movie and i recommend another musical that was in this film,negative
it wasnt good it was serious look at me im so annoying,negative
why would anyone want to see this sad why i dont know perhaps because they people made this got off on this sort of crap i mean,negative
and thats it why did i do this i was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good it wasnt and thats saying something,negative
so when i saw the name mr the film starts out strong unfortunately that was not to be the case seriously they had to go and make an entire movie off of it in other words its just not possible,negative
i wouldnt recommend anyone go see it dont pay to see this movie,negative
im writing this as i watch the dvd i didnt know anything about the movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good maybe on the stage this worked this is my idea of nothing sorry these single several minute long jokes dont okay i have,negative
what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written she was brilliant on all that and her own show then they get back together or break up at the end,negative
the film doesnt much work as a drama either its really too bad,negative
after seeing this i also unfortunately decided that it had been a waste of my time or the original for that matter,negative
how can you go wrong right man it really was bad at all in any way im sure,negative
one of the worst movies ive seen this year what a waste of time and effort,negative
okay that sounds all right there it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story his acting was as dull and poor as the movie,negative
was this meant to be serious at least i hope so,negative
well this movie falls in between so i guess if you really need to see it you could but i recommend you dont,negative
a few minutes into the movie i realize this isnt a bad thing,negative
enjoy it for his performance but dont expect anything else from this movie,negative
but i was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious the acting is decent and serious all the time and the musical score at first i thought was pretty good but nothing happens but that doesnt make a good movie yet does it,negative
was it good was it bad this is love was it supposed to be love,negative
i dont think this is that original a plot and it doesnt go out of its way to make itself anything more a something to watch when nothing else is on type movie,negative
this was not the worst movie ive ever seen but thats about as much as can be said about it and then nothing scary,negative
what the hell was all that about i knew he wasnt a good actor but this was beyond a joke,negative
oh my full stop dont watch it whatever you do,negative
ok so its a silly movie but i think they knew that when they made it,negative
but otherwise its boring and well stupid i think i got one good laugh out of the entire movie avoid this one,negative
i see people writing about how great this movie was it was horrible where the hell did they get the money just ridiculous,negative
and thats only scary part to the whole movie i dont know why i do these bad things to myself run for their lives of course and where did all those bad guys come from anyway there were only a few people on the island to begin with and dont get me started on the editing stay away,negative
i have never seen such terrible performances in all my life not one decent actor actress in the whole film it was a joke,negative
there is nothing new here the acting is pretty bad then theres his relationship with a young woman and her son its just a pretty big waste of time,negative
could have done a lot more with this idea its a shame it turned out the way it did,negative
this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen its a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending mr one thing that i would admit was that there was a sex scene thats very hot,negative
but we decided it to watch it anyway and im sorry but this has got to be one of the worst films in history then it got to the end and by that time we had all lost the will to live and i know this has nothing to do with it but the name the team were given was just awful or thats what the film should of been called anyway,negative
head for the big city of course but wait but thats about it,negative
i like british humor i believe its one of the best in the world i mean whats so funny about that i dont know if you like this stuff watch it,negative
theres nothing new in this movie nothing you havent thought about before nothing you havent heard before the result is weird this is a funny world,negative
people are not as stupid as those portrayed in little man they couldnt possibly be,negative
i thought the film was not very good with too much violence and not one character to like,negative
let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan but what makes a horror movie next we all love suspense and when all else fails id call it more of a comedy i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror where will horror go next,negative
the acting is bad though not as bad as some movies ive seen thats because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects actually i cant think of anything,negative
ok there is not story line there is no plot the director tried to create a mystery it the feeling just wasnt there there is no good looking girl in the movie as well not one poor guy anything good guys do not go to see it there is very little action no suspense no hot girls girls a least the actors are good looking,negative
this movie was terrible the acting is absolutely terrible can you give me my time back,negative
i dont think any of them have actually read it,negative
the writing was bad the plot predictable and one thats been done far too many times i should know better than to watch made for tv movies,negative
i never really thought about watching this film oh no wait thats a terrible film not that the idea is bad in itself a good premise for a zombie film its small but its there and its annoying in fact it sounds like the score from but no she doesnt so why have her in so many scenes,negative
well maybe funny for a couple minutes but at least ill be able to laugh at least once,negative
i thought it should have been a little more serious than it was the movie turns out to be a murder mystery where did this come from,negative
this is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen where was the gore was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore,negative
i dont remember it being this bad i liked the theme song but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film again why i look at the film and think i think the same could be said for hollywood so you know its supposed to be stupid more like theyre the stupid ones let me say some good things i wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing i dont know because that character sure wasnt in the movie the film takes its title from,negative
only see this to make fun of it because if you go into this with a serious mind you might possibly kill yourself,negative
its plot was terrible its horror wasnt really that good its sci fi was even worse,negative
this is an awful film i need not watch this again,negative
its stupid jokes nothing is the same its supposed to be really stupid and hilarious but the actors dont act stupid to me this is just a typical american tv show,negative
just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be the acting was bad at best,negative
theres a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating,negative
ive seen worse acting directing script etc but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie so it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not i tried to watch the sequel but it was exactly exactly the same thing as this movie,negative
one of the worst films i have ever seen come on what is supposed to keep me interested in that a film needs to have a reason to be interesting this is it absolutely awful,negative
this movie is god awful just good for them thats what it looks like on screen anyway how sad for you all i have nothing more to say,negative
those people who told me this movie is good shame on them probably someone else will like it,negative
this has to be one of the if not the worst movies i have ever seen but the best was the ending thats the ending at the end,negative
in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie,negative
such real life people just do not make good movie material,negative
i was really disappointed in this movie the whole time i watched it i kept thinking of how much better it could have been,negative
this movie was a stupid piece of crap bad everything,negative
this movie was obviously made with a very low budget but did they have to make it so obvious,negative
did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year not enough lines but what else can be said,negative
the movie is just not worth it maybe as a theater play but certainly not as a movie and why do they call it a thriller,negative
all three of them as much as men do even s,negative
man are you serious did you read the book or watch this movie you remember him dont you i have read all three of them no i am not a fan they were given to me this was an interesting real life story but not a good movie over it,negative
youre wrong i dont think ive ever seen a made for tv movie or after school special this bad it didnt,negative
well i did not see any at least not something special i never saw before oh give me a break,negative
i was wrong it was bad from beginning to end now that would have been interesting,negative
we have seen their lot many a time over in many films nothing new here i found it on late night tv and since there was really nothing else on i watched the whole boring stupid film what a total waste the rest no way,negative
perhaps thats not the best way to start a review of this movie,negative
which is a sad thing to say because it was written by mr him fighting himself i wont,negative
there are so many problems with the film there is a lot wrong with this film which i dont have time to go into but i say it should be avoid,negative
who was it her son what was the scene supposed to show us,negative
i loved the original it was brilliant and always will be the end in the original was fantastic this it was if they were trying far to hard to be different and then,negative
what a waste of some great talent i was very disappointed with this movie as it was not what i expected,negative
what gives can you possibly enjoy this movie sure you can,negative
which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew,negative
when they have a decent storyline my daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her,negative
this is a comedy too bad none of the jokes are funny the cast is the only thing that kept me watching but the script is against them,negative
this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen,negative
first time i ever felt i needed to write a review i can like good movies in a genre like horror or comedy even if the movie might not be that great i also will try to rate movie fairly even if i did not like it try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was what is wrong with some of you do not waste your life,negative
right seriously this is probably the worst film ive seen this year,negative
most of these in those days were badly done with silly plot if they had any so there are very few that can stand out and even if they were good they are still not very good ok thats possible were here then were not here maybe awful,negative
that being said there are some nice performances but not enough,negative
i completely wasted my time watching this film the best part would have to be the ending credits,negative
didnt we already have enough oh god here its a bad one so please,negative
why was this movie made in the first place where did they get the money,negative
here we go the rest of the characters are not much better there should be something good in this movie after all and there is the actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work and thats a big plus,negative
a a but there is really little development of any of them a,negative
at least i think so well im not sure i should even say because im not sure there was one whatever the script was silly unfortunately i still dont like it,negative
then there was the acting again i was disappointed the rest of the cast was average by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles overall this was a sad film i dont think so,negative
bad really bad which is the theme for the whole movie,negative
which isnt all for not either same could be said for a lot of the movie,negative
or something like that it isnt okay so it doesnt look that good,negative
i have been reading comments on imdb for some time now but i just did oh,negative
avoid avoid avoid this movie was straight to dvd for a reason that being,negative
the thing looks like a very very big budget school play or indeed a very very low budget action movie which it actually is,negative
in our case you may even see it in the actual films just leave it alone,negative
it didnt look like a real movie it looked like a home video this is no horror movie it never did get any better i didnt find that entertaining at all i have this to say to the cast and crew dont do it i say this have a nice day everyone,negative
its just a non movie in which nothing interesting happens this horrible non movie,negative
and if there were enough people like me it may even have made money most people never get to see themselves or their work up on screen,negative
with some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made this can be pretty annoying the movie has three parts,negative
i will start this off by saying i couldnt get all the way through it was i wrong or what the acting isnt much better overall its the worst movie ive ever seen,negative
all of our movies and as often as possible thats all im saying then theres the monster need i say this movie is bad good,negative
right how many more of these movies has hollywood made when will this movie end etc by now you get the point and one other thing,negative
its little wonder that this movie was written by a woman,negative
leave the acting to actors not that anyone in this movie was that great ive seen the major characters in movies where they were much better,negative
just what we need things can only get more worse unfortunately more went wrong with the all new dr then again the original version wasnt any good either,negative
in fact id say its pretty much of a mess you can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with it,negative
i didnt feel anything in this film havent we seen this all before i felt bad for him not a bad film not a good one,negative
well were to start the camera action doesnt help either,negative
when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies you get what you pay for i would probably never watch this movie again the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse just your average movie,negative
im not a fan sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt,negative
they told me i didnt miss much while i was gone either im really sorry about that too,negative
i just watched this movie with a few friends they said i had to see it but from the beginning i knew it was going to go from bad to worse,negative
it was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously being at the wrong place at the wrong time,negative
why not is because its one of the worst movies i have ever seen yes it ends up all over them great stuff this movie is very very bad,negative
but i like it anyway i watch it for the song i wish i had it,negative
terrible amazing how very funny this show is so great why would you even try the other two shows actually have some decent character development,negative
people who think its the best movie and people who think its the worst first of all the sound,negative
however even on its own this movies plot is not good having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story dialog and decent acting life is too short to watch this movie,negative
or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me then this is a movie for you otherwise dont see it,negative
movie ends i really want to know what the point is why write back and do tell me what i need to learn,negative
you dont make sense thats who makes sense brilliant enough said hilarious hilarious,negative
how how awful is it oh no one time everyone,negative
what was the point of this show i was very very disappointed im not even sure that the history is even very close a lot of good story that could have been gone to waste it was sad and i wish that i had not watched it,negative
i tried but the last ending that really was a waste of time,negative
ever just your average party but theres some guy there if you know what im saying alone well almost,negative
i must say i was rather disappointed in my opinion a waste of time,negative
okay basically because i just couldnt bring myself to care for any of the characters i just kept thinking oh well i dont know oh well what can i say,negative
ive seen worse before everything about it is bad the lack of suspense the lack of actual horror or character development the lack of a decent storyline,negative
whats wrong with this film if you havent seen this movie dont waste your time watching it i think you get the picture,negative
this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen if you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it might be worth your while,negative
i wanted to dog this movie but somehow i cant find it in myself to do that right up to the very end but that wasnt enough to save his performance i dont hate his acting i also have to say that the effects were very b class effects what effects there are but all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attempt,negative
do you get it like the car well maybe not that one s,negative
i got this film off a friend and he didnt want it back its so bad,negative
i just saw this movie i liked the soundtrack and is so predictable you know the end from the very first minutes nothing new in this movie something new this is not a must see for sure,negative
how does anyone keep on seeing horror movies after this one and love horror movies but come on it as no history and what have they took its typical the movie is boring from the beginning until the end but what can i say i think everyone should see it because my opinion is my opinion may be you would like i dont think so but,negative
well i thought wrong whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie,negative
there are so very few films where just the title tells you all you need to know about the film now what could have given him that idea,negative
this was by far the worst movie ive ever seen i didnt think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age i was wrong,negative
this movie was way too slow and predictable i wish i could say more but i cant,negative
it turns out that this movie is ten times worse than life,negative
and unfortunately so did i i dont remember much else,negative
how was this a horror movie there are much better b movies out there,negative
ive been a classic horror fan my entire life i dont think ive ever seen a horror picture where everything was so matter of fact dr no big deal hes gone just like that she dr,negative
there isnt all that much else here thats interesting though,negative
was i wrong they must have needed the money badly,negative
i love action movies but this is not an action movie this isnt a movie,negative
or at the very least way over the top its that stupid and you wont remember him from this they dont make it good mind you they just make it its very very very bad,negative
i know she can do better then find a better script and budget bring in a better script and direction and id come back again,negative
what a waste and as for the plot well none of it makes sense,negative
of course the film had no effect on its audience thats all well and good,negative
so what about the action there is nothing to save this movie there is not a single good line and not a single good joke so what does it have,negative
someone in hollywood needs to re make this movie and i think it would be a big hit the story is interesting and creepy,negative
the opening scene makes you feel like youre watching a high school play but ive seen high school plays with better acting i found the character development to be poor and the acting very forced,negative
what happened but the only lame here is the end sorry,negative
this may just be the worst movie of all time never have i seen such horrible film making before in my life,negative
old style animation would have been much better than this,negative
thats really about the only line that is funny in this film,negative
apparently he couldnt even find anyone to act in his movie so he cast himself maybe he thought that was enough the director cast himself,negative
however the movie had some dumb parts about it s dead the lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done the husband and wife have some major relationship problems and its funny to watch how dumb they are with each other he was the best actor and character,negative
you never said anything about battle they could at least have tried,negative
it really should be a made for tv movie come on give me a break the soundtrack,negative
well i didnt think it was that bad that was funny of course the family has a hot daughter for the love interest,negative
that is exactly why i enjoyed the movie so much,negative
s as far as the quality goes its not an awful film its just not very good,negative
if you dont take him too seriously then hes actually kind of fun to watch,negative
this show was absolutely terrible for once i want to see something original in my opinion they already did,negative
the plot is boring and stupid i wish i had my money back,negative
this movie was so awful i dont even know where to begin it was ridiculous there was just no background to any of them im the man,negative
well then rent this movie however id rather just watch a good movie which this is clearly not how come the rest of the movie cant be that good,negative
the story and the characters really really needed work just get people talking about something we care about really does anyone fall for him in these movies no why,negative
i really dont get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it theme nothing to learn from this film soundtrack crap crap crap,negative
the battle scenes on the dvd copy i watched were almost completely black,negative
when i started watching this film i was completely happy,negative
the story was lame action wasnt all that great same goes for the quality of animation i found it very poorly any i mean come on,negative
so is the rest of the movie ok it is ridiculous as a premise the whole thing is bad,negative
instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made,negative
i am not sure how i felt about it as a kid but i am sure i enjoyed it because it was new to me and id watch and enjoy anything back then dont watch this people unless youre hard up,negative
i didnt think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do even for all that there was something here that kept me watching,negative
so this movie is quite the experience because thats what we all do sex its easy,negative
in his stand up he jokes about it getting great laughs,negative
no idea the director was probably his brother work but its weird maybe they worked in it back when yes its that awful,negative
who told any of the so called actors that they can act,negative
yet some people will simply love it for being so cheap and so poorly made sometimes i enjoy movies like this,negative
the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word,negative
what is going on here can this even be called horror please stop these fan boy want to be directors now,negative
why oh why has this film been made there is a plot that is it but no which goes for the film as a whole,negative
if you really want to watch a movie and laugh please dont watch this in short the movie is worth a miss,negative
and i also liked to see how would he do i must say he is excellent in his role the direction is average the editing is poor the story is boring he has a lot of female fans the story is predictable,negative
in reality though hes just more boring than boring much of it is in french,negative
let me tell you a story you know so on,negative
but after a while it just started to fall apart for me i wanted to see more of her real character,negative
i dont think you can get much worse then this you look great not the more stories you go through the worse it gets was silly to say the third one has no point boring music yes bad who couldnt even hear some parts it was stupid guess not good movies use that,negative
never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie i mean i dont even know what to say good day,negative
at least for me i have been following the career of mr i was expecting more but this time mr,negative
i actually saw this movie in the theater back in its original release the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow and the ending was ridiculous but this film should never have been made,negative
enough about that lets get into his role in short i didnt like his character even though i was supposed to,negative
what can i say not much to this one at all the actors performances are just ok,negative
stupid humor is one thing but just stupid is another,negative
why did i have to go out and buy yes buy well i was so dead wrong the acting well dont even go there a lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all off screen t what a let down could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie but i guess that was the whole point of it boy you really have to see it to believe it so the man seems to have some talent after all way to go mr,negative
really i dont know about you but it never came to my town so there you go oh and one more thing whats up with that,negative
and the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion,negative
whom after a while fight back it was probably just a couple days worth maybe oh i dont know dont waste your time,negative
i dont think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film,negative
after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review,negative
lets talk about the plus points of the movie the girl etc etc etc,negative
the plot is predictable the acting isnt great but really the dialogue is the worst part dont you die on me not now,negative
and it is this film and i have seen a lot of bad movies believe you me it was bad but i still liked it despite my one star rating,negative
i think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does,negative
it is quite simply the worst movie i have ever seen it is terrible,negative
the story is ok but not very entertaining the ending is bad really bad you will know what im talking about when you see the movie,negative
not once were any of the scenes believable i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid,negative
ive seen the original many many times in fact i own it she must know what shes doing well i dont know what to say i dont understand what happened,negative
actually a lot of people do and ill start but then something happened it was certainly better than i expected guess what its boring too hes actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster,negative
who were these characters why didnt i care about them,negative
ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater we decided to stay for the entire movie he he,negative
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it doesnt change the fact that this is a very boring movie to watch,negative
so far for the horror elements this movie has t what about his western movies exactly that last one was totally lost on me dont know where they got that idea from its just really really dumb,negative
this film is really bad no i mean really really bad i just cant feel for her in films all in all this film is bad thats it,negative
it is dont do so anyway i wanted to see this film at home only of course but now just after i am absolutely disappointed it was his worst movie ever bad actor play,negative
this was the most god awful movie i have had to sit through,negative
this movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book i was so disappointed when i finally saw it,negative
right does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie of course she isnt supposed to enjoy it and that is what i mean about this movie why couldnt they have given her something to enjoy lets try to make sense of this some romantic love story enough,negative
dont believe me youll find that here get it i couldnt believe what i was seeing who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke badly watch the ending that is actually the ending,negative
but nothing could save this piece of crap movie its just bad,negative
plot is terrible acting is even worse and there is no development at all i watched this with three other friends who i hope are still talking to me,negative
i like end of days movies i like b movies none of these things kill the movie this movie is just boring,negative
i have never seen the tv show and after watching the movie im not going to start any time soon it was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through the acting wasnt very good i wasnt expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny shes famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things she is pretty but shes a weak actor he doesnt do a good job here though as the story is a mess the movie is also pretty long for a comedy,negative
this move was on tv last night but the story is too ridiculous for words dont even get me started on the actors,negative
this is overall pretty ridiculous and the acting is horrible but the acting is the least of what this is about and what is it about,negative
if this is the best movie that this couple has ever made then im pretty sure im not interested in any of his previous ones,negative
this film is so bad its almost good come on,negative
the characters are weak the background animation that is the plot was the worst im not so sure about that the plot was bad so how could it know more about anything after that this would have made more sense,negative
just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong and fast i couldnt give away the ending even if i wanted to i simply couldnt understand it,negative
they seemed ok same old cheesy horror crap but i was interested for some reason so i turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting i was very wrong,negative
i could name plenty of funny movies this is comedy,negative
it simply falls off the end really dont waste your time on this one,negative
no reason was ever given maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy,negative
one of the most boring movies ive ever seen i gave up after an hour and ten minutes,negative
he does have a very major part in it so fans might enjoy seeing him however i believe most of his fans are young girls who may be turned off by the violence in this movie,negative
it is a story as old as man the end is predictable,negative
the script is not only obvious but terrible what a waste,negative
the writer based his story on war stories their were plenty of funny stories that could have been shown,negative
however the same is not true of this film then i might have been able to sit through it in any case it could have been done much better,negative
much as id like to i simply cant get to where i care even a little about these characters,negative
this is by far the worst film i have seen in my entire life as for special effects the film has none well thats about it this review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch,negative
this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin i should have given it three out of ten instead of five,negative
yes and no as for this show its very much like her comedy when it works its hilarious when the jokes hit theyre brilliant when they dont theyre awful and i mean really awful so should you watch this show,negative
part of the opening is re used in the series,negative
another example of playing with fire sure i understand it happens to some people but it was hard to watch,negative
youre getting the idea the film has been looked at as a series of scenes and not as a complete story,negative
think about it scene one is very good all the rest are crap,negative
etc etc how about some interesting bad guys writer director a awful awful awful,negative
yes but that was about the only surprise in the film,negative
was the director trying to make a bad movie i dont think so worst film in movie making history,negative
and even then even they can live without seeing it if free remember that time is money too,negative
we watched it in english class and this movie made absolutely no sense i would never ever watch this movie again,negative
i cant believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie,negative
the gun is probably the worst film ive ever saw is another suspense in which it is very hard to get into finally nothing in this movie is any good,negative
this movie isnt that great this movie is good for someone young the movie was really predictable,negative
he does not seem to have any talent of his own,negative
this movie is sad it makes absolutely no sense there is a lot of gore cheap gore it doesnt even look real,negative
poor acting poor plot and poor direction oh let her die soon and let me die soon too please,negative
awful and i can feel it here all in all this is a movie to avoid,negative
and the characters what characters thats the point of the situation comedy and the directing or lack there of remember the one,negative
not even bad enough to be so bad its good,negative
that film is probably the most boring film i have ever seen since its not even bad enough to be funny i well like i said,negative
i feel bad for the writers it could have been good,negative
theres really no reason for them at least this is a tv movie,negative
this film should have been fun in space i mean back to the future is great i dont recommend this film to anyone,negative
and thats what happened with this film i havent gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends now that was funny,negative
or maybe not but since theyre not so famous to say the least i wasnt expecting much of them if i remember right i did both,negative
the characters are not very original and not particularly interesting,negative
no no ok were already in deep water sure the husband different story if id seen it in a theater did it get any release one very good thing though,negative
but this has got to be the worst ive seen its not even funny i find nothing good to say about this movie,negative
i know i am wouldnt he want to live it just makes it worse ive only seen a few minutes but it was terrible i would think so more bad guys more of everything less bad guys in the end it only seems like there is two or three bad guys come on the look of the film is good but thats it i dont even think fans of gore will like this though im probably wrong the gore does nothing in my book you dont even feel like you have seen anything new,negative
there are to much action it happens to much things and you cant help wonder why it happens if you have to much time at hand i would say you can see it if not dont,negative
or see it on budget dvd whatever you do dont waste any money on it,negative
the writing acting directing and everything else in this movie is just terrible or he is one of the people who worked on this movie,negative
a do feel sorry for the pretty things though i went there once,negative
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie,negative
its ok i guess but nothing special the acting is the worst of seen in the series up to this point,negative
i cant believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the plot was so horrible it made no sense and the acting was so bad that i couldnt even tell if they were trying,negative
one of the things that makes this movie awful is the acting dont waste your time on this one,negative
the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when im making fun of it now lets talk about the show,negative
this is about the worst movie i have ever seen just an example of the quality,negative
big and like the other films mr big the same could be said for the gun play even if shes a good shot she was rather slow and the guys just seemed to wait until she killed them a whole lot better,negative
oh well its funny this is a good one for friends but i wouldnt recommend it for anything else,negative
seeing it a third time nearly three years after the second i didnt care much for it at all im not even sure what i found so good about most of it in the first place cant remember now a a,negative
it shows in the lack of quality what a waste,negative
but this movie disappointed me i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown,negative
please give me a break here at the end of the movie,negative
you got it the plot is predictable and sometimes you actually feel like youre watching a school play the female characters have little or nothing to say,negative
the fantastic mr and also the plot well its kind of boring fantastic mr lots of people still seem to like it look at the reviews maybe it just wasnt for me,negative
however reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about,negative
the problem is the role of the characters in the film,negative
this is a really bad waste of your time dont dont,negative
was it a case of if we cant get lee we wont have a monster at all why would they do that the monster is half the fun of the whole thing why,negative
what a waste of time ten stars seriously come on,negative
in an action film no less great fun for the whole family,negative
i dont know i was not happy with the ending do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy,negative
it makes one wonder how this show is still on the air the show can be entertaining at the beginning its just like in real life what is true love exactly its not realistic how could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others making out with them,negative
it doesnt come off the film begins with them running from the police,negative
this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life it was poorly made and the actors couldnt act it was a waste of my time and money it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case which watching the credits was the best part of the movie,negative
you must see this film just to know how bad film making can really be,negative
there is no reason to see this movie the acting is awful,negative
there was a few funny parts that movie had a few funny parts but overall pretty ridiculous plot or lack of,negative
very weak but it definitely not best his role other characters bad is not that word ridiculous plot is really shame especially we dont see it anyway movie is weak without main characters it would be just,negative
oh my god i wanted to die the acting was just awful the best part of the show was the theme song,negative
i wouldnt say theres anything scary here the acting isnt great though it certainly could have been better,negative
and she wont let him rest until he does so and the viewers too this movie is truly one of the worst movies ive ever seen you wont be disappointed,negative
the plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add many times before in my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film,negative
that said this is not a well made movie this isnt it though too bad,negative
not only one cinema theater this is one of the problems that we are having in the same time i could be wrong though the ideas are good but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie i havent seen the movie yet,negative
so whats the real problem it didnt in fact maybe never,negative
what happened here i guess thats so the production team can come up with an ending,negative
mr because to me i enjoy mr mr but even hes not near enough to save mr,negative
but here he had no power all in all i was very disappointed i really expected much more from this director and cast,negative
theres nothing special here that you need to see all of these actors should know better and its hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it,negative
so that tells you that the movie is going to be bad anyway but i am not saying that all old movies are bad second the special effects were terrible for even that time,negative
this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen but i couldnt find anything entertaining about it we couldnt believe this film was as terrible as it was,negative
sounds like a place we would all hate to be right,negative
you wont believe some of the lines these actors have to say so bad it becomes fun again,negative
this is one of the more poorly made movies ive ever seen,negative
the cast is better than usual and while the story and the plot are a total joke at least most of the action scenes look pretty good the plot is probably one of the worst in film history what happens there are a lot of moments in this movie that are good for laughs,negative
please life is too short for these kind of movies unfortunately its already too late for me,negative
the child actors were annoying decent death scenes though overall ive seen worse i,negative
i know the songs i love the characters and i love the story it was terrible lets start with the story not sure where that came from he also had no good songs in this movie whos the mother really i will look back at this movie and just laugh,negative
dont laugh i just want to play with it all day,negative
i have never seen a worse movie you dont get a chance why,negative
strange and it was really boring i dont get it why people liked it,negative
actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies obviously not oscar material and if your not into zombie movies or b movies you probably wont enjoy this but if you are youll like this movie it was a good ending to at least i thought so,negative
the editing is good acting decent sound effects arent too over the top,negative
this must be one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
all different and yet all the same a story a development of character yes even in action films this can happen,negative
you could tell i dont know about you and your family but i do not think that i could have filmed a sex scene with my sister again i felt that lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent there were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end,negative
anyone with a camera would get the same result or better the director mr and dont go for writer either by the way,negative
this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen,negative
the lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all,negative
the so called surprise ending is awful as is the rest of this film,negative
this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time,negative
i wasnt able to last ten minutes on the this terrible film,negative
whats the word im looking for but no after all i did stop watching this movie after mr,negative
i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason it is awful,negative
she didnt seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself god is love,negative
i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not,negative
right now theres a story which would move me character development too little too late,negative
does this make sense no well dont feel bad because it doesnt make sense,negative
the whole movie was poorly written poorly directed and poorly acted and as bad as those old movies were this is actually worse im done ive given way too much of my life this crap movie,negative
but i still wanted to watch it because im a huge fan of the game and i wanted to see what does the film have that makes it so bad or the girls are is it supposed to be a comedy or horror or both,negative
definitely the entertaining scenes in the film excellent dialog worth plenty of laughs and then its over,negative
then again maybe this film was just bad and the plot,negative
i really didnt like this film the plot was very predictable typical american plot im sorry guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end sorry,negative
i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end i cannot comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i couldnt watch it was because of the actors how can anyone take that seriously,negative
give it a second chance and youll see what i mean,negative
this is just a bad movie it almost were etc almost but in the end its just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better so as you so if you still have a chance just watch something else,negative
the comedy simply isnt funny and the drama is boring and badly acted,negative
this show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made,negative
i really dont know how anyone could ever actually enjoy watching this,negative
im trying to view all of his work unfortunately this is not one of them please avoid this film,negative
the action isnt terrible cinematography and editing are fine the music is cool enough,negative
i dont know why this has the fans it does and i dont know why i have even given it the score i have,negative
its only a problem when it isnt funny as in this show,negative
the film starts with some laughs which run well throughout but that is it thats all the film has got going for it,negative
never seems to know where its going next as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film,negative
how awful is it theyre scary wait actually its not even that good all dialogue no action what direction the opening theme music was actually very good,negative
this was a terrible film watch this film if you like why not in short bad story,negative
forget that stuff and forget this show it only got worse,negative
the idea of the film is actually a good one i just dont understand how something like this ends up like this,negative
than the man alone were awful it will help a lot,negative
and of course what would a movie be without sex,negative
i can sit through this movie once but i doubt i could make it through a second time go see this with your little ones i,negative
where do i begin with why it did so well the film was so dull in my opinion didnt feel it the twist,negative
to be sure i went to watch the film and what do you know why cant he just take it easy the music is not too bad,negative
the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between,negative
because this one deserves it well at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is,negative
what do you call a horror story without horror and story even that film knew more about itself we really know nothing about the characters b acting is ok in this type of horror films but theres not much to act in the script we dont care about the characters theres nothing to remember about them too bad really,negative
i dont know why they even kept the name poor lady,negative
to make a long story short this film is horrible in every way,negative
from then on it all gets a bit silly a couple of hours of my life that id like back,negative
it wasnt as if these films were works of art it wasnt as if they were really even very good,negative
but it fails at least for me and for my friend too everything that happened happened only on the screen it was always there not here where i am its not real,negative
its just incredibly bad if so this ones an example,negative
this is my first review on imdb i think that fact alone says something about this movie not a good thing where better to do it than imdb i would recommend to not waste your time but then again if i were you id probably want to experience it myself,negative
one of the worst films i have ever seen because this movie isnt scary at all the plot and acting of this movie was terrible please please dont make cinema like this,negative
each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer,negative
but a few obvious ones stand out and ill go into them you get the idea perhaps this was meant to be funny but it just comes off as sad the score at the end there is no music at the beginning and even as straight to dvd movies go this is a poor effort,negative
this is his worst film he has ever been in the acting and the story was just terrible,negative
it cant really call this cinema i am also surprised that people who make comments here in imdb say that this movie is a masterpiece,negative
what am i saying what the i couldnt even figure out the credits,negative
in fact it looks absolutely awful black and mr black and mr,negative
well how do you even rate a movie such as this one,negative
it is quite a long scene what was the point i really would not recommend this movie,negative
the camera shots make it so that you cant see whats going on,negative
i dont know what the people involved in this film were thinking the acting here is particularly bad it was the only part of the movie i enjoyed,negative
here it gets a little more interesting but not enough to save the film the acting overall is horrible as the late great dr,negative
you see that every so often i was watching this thinking but no ok ok right,negative
i just dont get how anyone could like this movie,negative
back to the film at hand you wont get it here,negative
this happened with end of days i liked it the first time i saw it i thought it was entertaining well its bad everything about it is sad,negative
imdb but didnt quite get there what isnt this isnt one of them dont waste your time,negative
plus its very hard to make it through the entire film,negative
its not that bad the movie might have been better without them at all it was an okay flick for what it was,negative
yes its so not good and so much fun and i am one of them in case you didnt know already,negative
no and dont get me started on the acting okay that got me started but never again,negative
get the idea theres not an original moment in this whole movie,negative
unfortunately we then meet or main characters not here instead its all over the place if you tried really hard,negative
they are great he is very annoying not funny oh yes he want to get some serious action with her but every time her family comes in between i like his movies all these stories arent interesting thats written on his life as an actor,negative
i thought this was poor sorry but that is just wrong,negative
imagine not once not ever but the thing is we think its funny but show me the humor the movie is just not funny all the time you just know its going to end well again,negative
this could have been so much better than it turned out in person,negative
this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesnt quite i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong,negative
it starts quite good but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting i think this film is boring it could be done better at least they tried sorry guys,negative
but did he does any of this sound funny if you wanted to make a comedy about you could but man of the year isnt it,negative
there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning but its fun to write about it i will never watch the show again every year they do something wrong a beautiful mind is up for best make up that will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show,negative
the sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of b movies,negative
i thought i will not watch that movie never again,negative
actually i had seen it years before when it was released at that time i didnt think it was that bad a movie,negative
this movie was definitely the worst movie ive seen in my entire life and ive seen some pretty bad movies i didnt like the way this movie was filmed but its absolutely horrible ive never seen a worse movie the story is too weird i didnt like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie,negative
im not sure he could make a movie any worse than this yes its that bad,negative
let alone talk about it the movie does not even show bad times the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie i feel that the movie is evil the second problem with the movie is it was just bad bad acting bad special effects bad plot and poor character development,negative
and thats saying a lot after this film actually he is not bad in it that would have been a great story,negative
poor plot poor acting this leaves little left bad not even so bad its good material,negative
this sounds like a great film and some of it is pretty good but there is plenty wrong with this movie also the music is far too dramatic in some scenes will i ever watch this again maybe,negative
but it is still not a very good movie yes hes big and scary looking in his role but i just hate the guy as an actor there were little things i liked about the film so anyway mr,negative
this is probably the only movie i have ever not been able to make it all the way through,negative
i would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent the plot action etc my favorite scenes,negative
its the worst movie ive ever seen im being a nice guy when i call it movie just another big budget made to someone who doesnt like to think much its not even scary,negative
fans of the series seem to think this is a good film best part of the movie,negative
i doubt it was her first however it never goes there,negative
if you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good then this may be for you,negative
this one however is beyond bad but most people dont now if that isnt enough so how could they hit you again so there you have it what a movie not,negative
such is the case here similar to the ones on their tv show they knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it,negative
i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production,negative
but oh man did i hate those actors so stupid,negative
and an extremely bad one at that i can see why now at least ive never seen them before in any type of major show theater or tv and that wasnt even the worst of it i did,negative
the sad part is that no one does this stuff to themselves,negative
these movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world in order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and im sorry to say pretty bad acting,negative
if you even think about watching this piece of crap movie dont not anyway worst movie ive ever seen,negative
this story starts at the end it could have been a much better film than it turned out to be he has made some good films and is still making them i would not recommend this film to anyone,negative
i expected a lot more out of this film the obvious low budget of the film was nice to see i enjoyed that the movie was filmed on just a script a bad one at that and just a few actors it was a nice change,negative
she just lets them all go without saying a word,negative
period yes i couldnt really sit through the tv series episodes they just felt cheap see the movies first and youll know what im talking about,negative
whatever the time or place i want a good story comedy or drama i also want to see some enjoyable characters,negative
as the for the major problem the plot was there one it was ridiculous,negative
it started out with an interesting premise the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written,negative
whats her name was as pretty as usual it could have been a good movie,negative
i watched the entire film with my family and some friends i have no idea what the movie was about i am disappointed it could have been much better,negative
i could not believe it and nothing ever happened nothing,negative
this movie is just a waste of time run away run away,negative
the first one was different and funny this movie does not make you laugh,negative
it needed to be more like the good earth released just the year before,negative
after about an hour i couldnt wait to get it over with,negative
i kept thinking what a waste of film every time it happened yes it does happen more than once if you can believe it im watching a movie here it would be nice to be able to see then there is the ending i was watching alone too dumb dumb truly horrible,negative
guess what though why that was it that was how far they thought things out go,negative
i got all the little in jokes some people will love this,negative
this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen horrible acting not funny at all and well just boring otherwise dont waste your time as i did on this one,negative
cheap looking and worst of all boring action scenes the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence,negative
these are two actors that i like they just did an awful job in this movie it was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy all in all i would have to say it wasnt completely awful but it wasnt much good if i could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it i would,negative
the worst of the worst no talent what so ever actors stupid plot is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what this is by far the worst film i have seen in my life,negative
bad acting yes but it was not a surprise stupid story yes so what what were you thinking mr director,negative
man what the hell were the people who made this film on thats how bad it is from here on in it doesnt get much better,negative
the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isnt enough to save the film,negative
i really wanted this film to be good really really well ever this film just doesnt come close but this film just isnt good then theres the music but wait theres a great message with this film right no really it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time,negative
i didnt know it was possible to release a movie this bad,negative
but he tries to keep away from his family however it appears his acting is still ok a good movie should never be like that,negative
bad is actually better than boring i thought they would never get there he looks around he looks around,negative
what sense does that make this film isnt alone most films seem to do this now,negative
but this isnt half as good my main problem would be that it simply isnt scary the story is basically the same as before you really dont care who or what this one is so there you have it really,negative
seriously i dont even know where to begin well was there even a director there and lame,negative
it did not seem real to me some of the acting was awful in particular that of the doctor she was about the worst ive seen,negative
out of high school as usual this is a bad movie with pretty good actors i think he did the best he could with the weak script there are none to be found in this movie,negative
its not that we dont get it we just dont want it,negative
ive seen this series and found it awful i mean ok its interesting to look but is it real,negative
what a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a day in the life dialogue horrible,negative
when i watched it on the movies i wanted my money back,negative
why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film the best bit,negative
it was good superb direction its a shame one star out of four,negative
apparently its supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isnt very funny at all s in fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have so maybe it wont help,negative
ive heard for a few years how i had to see this documentary and i finally watched it,negative
why should the viewer be alone one and a half stars,negative
thats it thats the whole story for most of the movie i was trying to figure out where i had seen the male lead i had plenty of time to think this over,negative
i give this one half star out of a possible ten,negative
it is shot on video not film video some of the actors give it their best shot her little girl voice works against her here but that is not saying much this has to be the worst film i have seen in years,negative
they were few and far between there i said it,negative
thats it best sequence ever it will be a night to remember,negative
there are just so many things wrong with this movie the original series had that well enough as did the first movie but here its just way way too much,negative
the fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script is beyond me bad actors and a really bad story,negative
i gave it three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting directing and writing are brilliant,negative
first thing i note is the music how does that scene even make any sense this just keeps getting worse wonder if they are the same ones we already got the point from the first movie so why was the sequel made could it get any worse,negative
if you havent watched this try it etc everything for the family,negative
i am so disappointed you need to open your eyes and look around you,negative
this is clearly a french film long takes it is a black and white film why do they do this well maybe the second,negative
hate to give away the ending but oh well the end,negative
didnt want to look but couldnt turn away a b have sex with your friends girlfriend all of the above stay away stay far away,negative
okay mr okay mr no no mr interesting mr what do you mean very original mr oh but there is i tried yes but but what mr mr,negative
i mean come on please stay away from this movie do not waste your eyes on it we had some good movies in our history and we had some bad ones but this one it is like nothing worse that i have seen in my entire life keep away,negative
the kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better this would be a good family move to watch with your children but most kids that i know who have seen the movie like it,negative
dr the story is fairly predictable and doesnt really give us anything new,negative
kids stuff does not have to be this way this was terrible,negative
did people stop watching it or is it that you just dont care,negative
is made up of talking and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through,negative
i was quite disappointed when i went to watch it,negative
its a masterpiece where everything is at the right place,negative
i have never seen so much time killing in a movie,negative
and isnt that better after all or indeed if anyone involved did from,negative
what was this movie actually about ive seen great films on this subject but this is not one of them i dont think so is it about sex is it about anything i dont know i am not it doesnt it makes it boring,negative
true the story line was good it did not work,negative
dialog i know you will enjoy it better now for all you people who enjoy good sci fi effects they say nothing much through out the entire movie,negative
so i saw the first movie still good though thats just the way it works,negative
to be more serious i cant say this movie is a bad moment but i didnt enjoy it either only the director knows it,negative
the production year says it all you get the idea but all this does not matter at all,negative
and when you look at this it is easy to see why where was the death,negative
i do not watch much television and came across this show reality show i sure hope this is not for real i really would like to know,negative
that was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling,negative
i didnt enjoy this film i thought the acting wasnt very good and the story was boring if that is what you want to watch do not watch this film,negative
i guess well have to get someone else a movie is an hour and a half long youre not saying we have him play a big name actor thats doing a low budget movie are you but we cant change the title now this is a case of good acting but bad writing and i hate to see it happen,negative
this is a good example of how not to make a film that alone does not make it a bad movie but it does make a bad movie worse,negative
the acting is bad the script is worse they had a good idea going in some parts but it never really came to past,negative
well himself then youve seen this dont know and doesnt make sense so didnt die what but still the last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time,negative
but even a big hollywood budget doesnt change the fact that the original plot was more believable b,negative
a the acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad this movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence are,negative
she being the best thing in this movie get real,negative
this has got to be the worse move ive ever seen who did the special effects bad actors total waste,negative
do not waste your time or your money on this movie it was and really not a good one almost dont waste your money and dont let your kids watch it,negative
and theres a lot of it then check the flick hell it might even be worth it,negative
i know about how good the original is supposed to be it had better be better then this one,negative
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
the movie is simply boring when it does get a little bit interesting it gets stupid come on how low can we possibly get,negative
what can i say the only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is,negative
this show really made women look bad i mean cant she just be happy,negative
when i saw that this movie was being shown on tv i was really looking forward to it too bad they didnt have better material to work with,negative
away they hit absolutely nothing i had a good laugh i guess,negative
until now i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring,negative
it wasnt even funny at all oh man bad so bad i thought the acting was really bad this movie not funny,negative
i actually liked some of it it is worth seeing this film only for his performance,negative
sex and the city has some great things going for it why do the writers do these things clearly to be over the top and to get your attention,negative
in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie,negative
this one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time sometimes movies are bad in a way that theyre actually sort of good not this one seriously what a waste shame on you whatever your name is shame on you,negative
for the whole film i wouldnt if i were you so go figure once,negative
it gets really bad so all in all its a waste of your life,negative
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason,negative
the actors cannot act ever the story is nothing new at all,negative
and is still acting but it was a weak effort,negative
i can be wrong this is like watching one of his home movies,negative
where to begin could these two be meant for each other well as it turns out unfortunately yes oh if she doesnt do this then her father is dead,negative
also the ending was a serious let down but as a low budget horror movie its pretty fun to watch that it takes itself too seriously,negative
this movie was fantastic great movie all through scary as hell but with a great movie comes a crap ending right right right wrong,negative
it was even worse than i could imagine it never did bad horrible terrible it was so bad i had to write a review,negative
is nothing else on tv however dont rent it and definitely do not buy it i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie something that this movie tries at,negative
so much for the plot what could she have been thinking,negative
everything in this picture is wrong totally wrong stay away from this,negative
two the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn who did it you think so what yes am i sorry i watched it no,negative
as for the story it was fairly interesting but rather slow i was especially disappointed with the ending though what a dumb ending,negative
four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film,negative
as for the premise of the movie its unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good,negative
its a wonder that it was ever put on video,negative
you dont see it just once you see it several times,negative
once upon a time there was a great american film think again the problems begin with the leading man basically shes a french girl playing the french girl as i myself did terrible,negative
so weak voice talent strong animation i dont get it,negative
i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie wasnt half as good etc,negative
this was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen they are always good for a laugh believe i know i have seen many which i probably should have acting and special effects were terrible,negative
no look ok thats enough it simply doesnt work this movie is a joke we want entertainment the rest forget it what the hell should that be the problem here is they mean this serious not as a joke why not oh my god not only because of the money,negative
even for a b movie this is down right awful after reading some of the good reviews i thought id keep an open mind and watch it but all the bad reviews were so right i totally cant understand how anyone could have enjoyed it they are many other better movies that deal with this subject matter,negative
a t do not waste your time watching this film,negative
most of the french films ive seen and enjoyed were more talk than action but thats okay it seemed that way but then it became talk talk and more talk which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery actually the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room,negative
nothing in particular just any movie what a great idea for a movie no one knows that were making a movie and the music oh the music i love well no and plenty of people would love to be told,negative
anyway this movie is a good laugh if you need something to make fun of definitely see it,negative
i watched it on video last night and i simply could not believe what i was seeing,negative
the acting directing cinematography and storyline were all horrible i would never recommend this movie to anyone s,negative
but thats what makes it a great watch it will give you more than enough good laughs the worse the better and look out for the very very end of the movie,negative
thing to a whole new annoying level what is this movie about,negative
he didnt make me but you know the movie body itself was quite good there was a lot of suspense then came the ending the ending was i get it,negative
out of this movie not so i was told the director wants it this way,negative
imdb possibly the worst movie ever made was it a complete waste maybe not god can use evil to work good he may have done the same thing with this movie im sure this actually happened to someone out there,negative
the whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life,negative
i would not recommend this for children this is how they are in this movie and it doesnt really work however we dont get that however you get some pretty good songs that pretty much sound the same,negative
it wasnt done the characters are weak the story was weak the directing was very poor but no nothing,negative
i will never forget the night i saw this movie,negative
if you have never read the book s i imagine you will enjoy the movie,negative
i will however give you my opinion of this movie one and a half stars out of four,negative
ok now lets see what was funny in the first movie no good all in all i give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts,negative
seeing this on tv back then was great either way its not a good movie but is a must see for one time only for horror and gore fans,negative
also he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward well that is not my problem i guess,negative
this was the worst movie my wife and i have ever seen,negative
i am looking for all his films to see everything happens,negative
no one coming into this film knows what they are in for i was there but no is the film shot well indeed do the actors act,negative
and another and another and another so what big deal so what i love a good action flick and i love a good thriller,negative
this show makes absolutely no sense you know the people who can actually do something about it,negative
the last stop could be an average thriller but the screenplay is simply awful,negative
this movie was so dumb and slow was it ever slow dont waste your time like i did watching this,negative
i dont like the baby and i dont like the dog thats it why was this sequel made,negative
bad idea this is just about the worst movie ive ever seen not even mr something but im still not sure,negative
apparently it wasnt the acting is wonderful from all the actors the story was stupid the female character was annoying as well a lot of the stuff she did didnt make sense thats about all there is,negative
i love good movies about high school and this is not one of them,negative
nor does it work at all as a romance how about as a romantic comedy not on your life it would probably make a better story,negative
perhaps so but he also the best thing about this film,negative
another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad not a film i would want to see again,negative
but otherwise there isnt much here great title that is wasted,negative
theyre really bad actors in fact everyone involved in this production is a non actor absolutely terrible a must see for any fan of bad movies,negative
this is the worst movie i have ever seen everyone i have never been so disappointed when watching a movie this was easily the worst movie i have ever seen either way they should never attempt to be in a movie again,negative
this film is about the worst i have seen in a very long time if you have time to kill and having nothing better to do then this is the movie for you otherwise watch something else,negative
he tells that to his parents but of course they dont believe him does it seem believable it does not out of,negative
as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the worst film ever made very low budget boring plot horrible acting really bad special effects etc it has nothing going for it either,negative
the first movie was bad enough if you ask me stupid this part is still ok i mean,negative
non the main actor was well cast in it but thats really the only good thing about this film,negative
im a big sci fi fan and i make it a point to watch all the sci fi shows i can,negative
and yes guys she shows if you know what i mean and i think you do what two stars,negative
there are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny,negative
it was not better sorry thats going a little far,negative
this life is truly as bad as it gets i dont think it is,negative
the jokes which are few and far between are not funny in any way,negative
all of this being said if you like bad horror movies you might like this one too it isnt the worst film of the genre but its far from the best,negative
this film was made and cast from my home town storyline that is never a good look the killer i did like the film but it was not great now i know it is a comedy and elements were funny,negative
i know i dont of course this is only my opinion,negative
dont even rent it youll hate it even if they believe than they can do it they cant s i am not who you think i am,negative
i guess i am coming late to the party it just wasnt enough fun no one seemed to mention this fact i got no sense of that in this version,negative
look out youll have to watch to find out for yourself,negative
but where was the sound you didnt hear it you felt it,negative
very strange hes a fine actor but mr a real let down,negative
however this years show was the worst one i can remember wonder whats next one of the better songs but thats not saying much a t to me t a t that performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most not because it looked good but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun and i could go on and on about how bad the songs were i wasnt surprised by the show though one for t a t,negative
i was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman,negative
why but it doesnt really add up yes its that cheap that being said the film is not without some good points a few action scenes are well done a four out of ten,negative
the lines in this well really awful and not the type of bad thats good,negative
what i mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take and the rest of the line is from a different take there were a few others,negative
yes it is great fun because of that i thought i should not miss this movie feeling it sometimes looks more like a documentary or real life show than a seriously made movie,negative
if you havent seen this film yet then simply dont,negative
war i mean come on why what this is stupid even for a kids film this is bad,negative
some of the actors directors writers etc not here as soon as i saw it i thought to add dramatic effect im sure,negative
because that is the real horror and its never away from reality,negative
i own this movie but if youre up to really badly made film this is the one for you,negative
her acting is pretty poor but i doubt thats why shes there,negative
so im not expecting much but it should at least have a story apparently they didnt have any time either the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie but it wasnt even that good,negative
i hate this movie so very very much some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously if only it didnt take itself seriously but it does,negative
this time there are only three stories instead of five,negative
next time guys if your going to make a sequel this bad,negative
first off the beginning did have elements of style but the plot was there one,negative
the beginning of this movie was good it started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself they made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy how could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day i also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie there were some good parts to this movie also some people might like it but i wouldnt recommend this to anyone,negative
the storyline was stupid i didnt laugh once in the movie i laugh at anything stupid usually,negative
the only good thing about this movie is that i now have a movie on the worst ever list,negative
its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them,negative
yet very few people have a good word to say about it,negative
it was very clearly made for tv yet if i found it on my television i would flick it straight over,negative
the show is average it doesnt make me laugh particularly its annoying,negative
it is a very dark film and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself,negative
why in the second one she is good one just cant leave a story like this,negative
oh my god what a horrible film the film has all the right people involved unfortunately it is not worth watching,negative
its not bad enough to be hilarious theres no gore all the same to me the eyes dont even move when theyre shot in close up but the last half hour of the movie did get better funny,negative
the acting is bad and this doesnt even look like a horror movie,negative
worse than the acting however was the story he her it is not as simple as that,negative
the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles no way,negative
yes but no as it is i just cant believe this was ever made,negative
this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen the only thing interesting about this movie is the box his actual name just has one great idea,negative
what a silly movie while it looks nice it doesnt make a lot of sense,negative
but it isnt i havent had so much fun watching a film in years the list goes on and on a must see,negative
most were movie stars in their own right it was a similar set up and it shows theres very much a made for tv feel about it,negative
no no i mean a lot a lot a lot but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off this was a movie,negative
first of all just let me say this and that is what they were trying to do now do you get it i admit this being said it still was not a good movie just not as bad a just about everyone else made it out to be,negative
watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor,negative
i made it about an hour through before i simply had enough now thats funny and the list goes on,negative
what does this mean i wonder anyway the script is terrible it is just a joke and the ending the ending,negative
the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters its more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is watching this movie felt like a waste of time,negative
my wife and i saw this in the theater when it first came out,negative
reading the other two comments i had to wonder if i had seen the same movie it gets better after the first half hour but i doubt most could make it that far,negative
it is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this,negative
this movie was so bad i couldnt sit through it without doing something else there was no plot and no point so how was this made,negative
what will they do but he cant act but the dialogue here is horrible it was just horrible this would have worked if the acting were better,negative
it looks like everyone had a lot of fun making the movie too his character was very enjoyable not a good movie but has a bit of fun to it,negative
and i must say this is the single best movie i have ever seen i mean exactly how cool the acting is so wonderful to and how many movies do you find that just dont make any sense not many thats really cool,negative
first of all this movie doesnt have much acting this in my opinion is of least quality,negative
i thought cool guys is just a ridiculous movie almost fun i want my money back but they didnt make it sorry about this but the movie is awful please please,negative
this film is really really bad and it happens to the whole cast come on guys it has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there,negative
but for those that had to watch them no way etc etc these arent even funny those are actually decent,negative
nothing in life would happen like this and as bad acting as youll ever see this is some very funny stuff,negative
the movie looks like it was shot in about one day with no thought at all behind it,negative
i just cant do it theres not enough here to go on and this is more of a movie to put on during a party because you could talk right over it and it wouldnt matter,negative
it simply doesnt come together like it should and thats a shame that would have made a nice little movie,negative
this movie is just another average action flick but it could have been so much better,negative
the star cast was new there is nothing worth watching in this movie makes me wonder why it was made in the first place,negative
the animation and all that special effects were extremely good but the movie wasnt the story of this movie was only meant for kids i am completely disappointed,negative
i wonder what happens to him if you feel you must rent this i say to you why,negative
no because i just did not understand this movie but this what is the director trying to tell us who knows i do not if you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for quite some time watch it,negative
so why wasnt it be cool tries too hard to well be cool,negative
this is our movie isnt it or is it because we happen to be film fans,negative
what makes her so different if it is because she has money why not go after her to start with,negative
i could be wrong no im not wrong this movie is not enjoyable on any level,negative
im a huge sci fi fan having said that the box is terrible and it just simply will not end but that doesnt mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it the main couple like i said you can understand whats going on yet it still makes little sense yes im being serious unfortunately but we found one here see what i mean you can understand it completely but it still makes no sense like many things in the movie the kid comes and goes moving on well again no nothing it would not end,negative
but its not bad if you dont like parents stay away from the film,negative
it would be hard to imagine a worse director it worked just fine that was the point what was the question the play made you understand theater people,negative
its got really good cinematography and little but nice music sad it also has script problems the writer was obviously trying to get everything straight and he does but it shows direction brings little to the weak screenplay actually its a rather important role and i cant see why non actors are cast for such parts too bad the world is full of great films and also of not that great films,negative
i heard many stories about this film being great i never seen any worse movie in my life so far god she looks nice in this movie thats about it,negative
why i have no idea what did i just watch,negative
the plot was pretty decent the other good thing was the cast the rest was quite boring but if youre looking for a good horror movie stay away,negative
etc no say it isnt so except to me it wasnt even ok ive read youre brilliant,negative
it needs no man to fall from the stars to save them this was poor character development human see human do,negative
cinematography was terrible editing was cut cut cut i have no idea where was his head cant say much for the acting either have read other reviews and see that others felt the same way,negative
there is not a single thing to recommend this film,negative
well wrong ever heard of re taking a scene acting was terrible direction was terrible make up was terrible possibly the worst make up job i have ever seen,negative
something that could never be found in the western serious films either dr,negative
however not only did i not like it i found it hard to sit through that is the entire movie,negative
i was so disappointed if not get her some help in the form of better writers for the show,negative
the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it,negative
i can only think of one reason this movie was released this movie is not the way,negative
it does not work here the cast was good except for michael of course a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production but someone should have thought about how to film it next time they do one of these i hope they call me first,negative
and it was absolutely horrible the acting wasnt fantastic but its hard to seem believable with such a terrible script,negative
you can tell things arent right with the story id like to see this movie re made and done better because it is a one of a kind story,negative
i had to watch this in school this movie is such a waste of your time dont even watch the movie you will be so disappointed how wrong she was the movies actors were just bad the best actor in there was the old man and thats not saying much its has horrible plot with awful characters,negative
a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one please,negative
it is so awful that i am not sure where to begin or even if it is worth it but that plot,negative
well id have to say that i do own this film and i only like the ending the movie is boring and slow but the final fight is so funny,negative
a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director stay away from this one please,negative
not to mention the movie was in english it never happened,negative
no no no no no no no this is just not good is it a love story is it a musical is it a drama is it a comedy its not that this movie is a bit of all its that this movie fails at everything it attempts to be for a second,negative
but the worst movie ever but there are worse movies,negative
terrible terrible movie for television you may ask why do i watch them then and the movie is so bad i cant get away from it guess what,negative
although ive seen some many more times than this they are still enjoyable,negative
didnt care for the movie the book was better does anyone know where it was filmed oh i just read where i need to write at least ten lines,negative
this was such a bad movie about such and interesting true story some sets were beautiful and realistic i really wanted to like this movie but i couldnt and the final shot made a beautiful picture though there are so many better movies to watch i dont recommend this,negative
theres pretty much no script at all i hate that this film should never have been released,negative
and totally non scary film the characters doesnt interest at all and most of the time is spent in a car and not the least something interesting must happen,negative
crazy i did find some particular problems with this film it simply didnt make sense,negative
need i go on you will work out what is going to happen if you do watch it anyway,negative
doesnt matter really as crap is crap is crap no yes the dialogue is always hilarious says our hero thats how memorable these characters are what the hell and mr,negative
who knows if a joke is funny its funny there are many scenes like that throughout the film not funny,negative
need i go on the actors appear to be reading their lines and not very well at that i love low budget movies just not in this movie,negative
it is awful almost everything fails in fact look up the cast on imdb none of them really went on to do anything much,negative
this movie is about one thing no more no less well maybe less,negative
i would never have thought he had it in him,negative
here are my problems with the film overall very sad acting and no point to movie,negative
this movie has a plot but it is all evil from start to end,negative
what happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters,negative
if it makes you think about the subject it has done its job even if you never believe,negative
soon the show gets better but not by much can you imagine lets see what else he just got them i guess they might as well give him a gun but what are the worst ideas nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again its like it never happened what the hell no one seems to mind the audience wont remember a short one at least a low budget movie sometimes i dont understand myself,negative
but thats as far as it goes it just doesnt work i dont know maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and i just didnt get it,negative
not his character his acting thats the best i can give it,negative
possibly the worst movie i have ever seen the effects are beyond a joke,negative
a good cast so many good actors and they are all acting so badly what was he trying to do,negative
this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen the production was probably the worst i ever seen the actors were absolutely the worst the story didnt have anything to do with what the back cover said boy was i wrong,negative
without really thinking it out they just dont seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie simple as that,negative
now dont get me wrong i love bad movies ok so thats clear but this is one of those films that was quite obviously trying to be something better but didnt make it why not so i will why are bad movies fun,negative
nothing much happens in this film the problem is that this movie is very predictable so if youre male i do not recommend this film to you,negative
this makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read,negative
this is one hour of just that for situation ive watched this show three times and still dont get the point of this series,negative
waste of time and waste of money what is up with that i will not recommend it to anyone at this time i would like my money back for this one it could have been more along the lines of reality,negative
this movie has a predictable plot bad writing bad acting bad directing bad special effects etc,negative
dont believe anyone who tells you this is good film i loved every minute of it,negative
this movie was absolutely terrible lets make a movie who wants to be in it its that bad,negative
what to say about this movie after playing around for some time things gets more serious guess what happens at the end this movie seems to be very low budget,negative
this isnt one of them nothing much happens really its all quite dull its not very funny,negative
so i was set nothing is scary about this movie at all if anything its funny funny how low the budget is funny how predictable it is funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it didnt make it is so stupid scary,negative
strange comes to mind again and again see it if you got time to kill but dont dont even try to take it seriously,negative
this version is no different anyway back to this version,negative
from there this movie gets worse way worse you get the point,negative
even with its low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here the actors and characters were interesting although there wasnt much character development some seemed to hate it and some seemed to think it wasnt too bad and then no female actors characters either none at all what gives,negative
the film was interesting and very unique i didnt like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you didnt know what was really going on,negative
the screenplay the ending there are other things that i didnt like about the movie but there are things that were all right,negative
its a complete waste but thats it nothing more nothing less but watch it and rate for yourself,negative
the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top,negative
they try to make this good but its too hard for them i think i think there will be a lot more of them the quality is poor and the acting could have been better too watch left behind instead,negative
i must say that i was truly disappointed not because of the music but the movie in itself,negative
i would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie the character mr,negative
well one is great and one is quite bad the great one is truly great in fact its the best the bad one is truly bad in fact its the worst and i also must say that this is one of the best worst movies of all time and it does,negative
this movie would have been better set on this setting ok friend leaves and goes to her car then the music which of course doesnt start so who say they cant help her but call back if she has any more problems they have been but only once like thats supposed to be scary much oh and did i mention,negative
the book that this movie is based off of has little action to begin with i would never recommend this movie to anyone theres no reason to watch it,negative
i do not think this girl can act in the least how many movies have this same type of plot i knew everything that was going to happen before it did,negative
the movie is a little worse than i was expecting,negative
the script is so predictable you can say the characters lines before they do why is she a movie star again but he cant save this film,negative
well the movie was a fun watch though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies,negative
the question is is they are going to be in love at the end i would say no as i said they tried to give something more for the audience her acting is a mess i mean its all over the place and so over the top,negative
what happens hilarious next thing you know the two women are going at it,negative
just seen which way to the front a terrible mess of a film,negative
s there is just something that tells you not to look but you do,negative
long live the strong female character in a horror movie,negative
the result a big waste of time theres little to enjoy here,negative
i tried overall however it was not really very scary the list goes on and on,negative
its just telling us things we already know that is if we can even figure out what its saying,negative
long ago that would have worked things are not as easy,negative
not everyone in town however is happy with what shes doing,negative
i had expected a classic drama but that was not the case again there are others who love this movie im just not one of them,negative
interesting plot very good acting but the result as a whole is poor in many ways you may think watch it if you have nothing else to do,negative
when i first saw this show i thought to my self what is this like what is that,negative
well acted yes nice cinematography but the script is lame really lame ok maybe the ending isnt as predictable but is it any good it is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already and forget about the day after i just got a note from imdb saying that my comment was not long enough thats really sad because i have no idea of what else to say about this movie which actually says a a lot about it dont you think the thing is its sad to see that this is a much worse film,negative
i didnt really like this movie that much at all no,negative
did i say one person well not quite got that right,negative
even for a tv movie one is left only to wonder why,negative
no wonder there was such a weak performance by all ok maybe not im sorry good call did she even want to be there or else were they not taken down add one more put your hand down i give me a break how stupid,negative
that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awful she just doesnt do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy in this its the viewer that does,negative
seriously this is really really bad yes it is shot video i cant,negative
i certainly didnt find out while watching this movie etc,negative
this is their premise of course perfect but still being such a bad movie it can be great fun to watch,negative
all in all a waste of film actors and air time,negative
i just dont buy it sorry and so boring but it didnt,negative
the one about how you cant look away this movie isnt that good the only reason youre still there is because you brought your kids and you cant leave them alone in the theater i didnt have much hope for this movie in the first place i admit the acting is mostly poor it does not work my son couldnt wait to leave,negative
he finds truly awful movies for us and tells us about them apparently we were wrong,negative
when she gets there shes surprised to find its the day of the dead i found it to be boring,negative
in reality the show is so badly put together that you cant even really see the performances,negative
i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film,negative
theres nothing funny about forced humor the death of american cinema has been a slow one whatever happened to real humor this movie is bad,negative
ok not bad movie making if it were from an original script but it is not give it up it is a bit creepy but good,negative
why thats the question i ask here thats another thing the film takes itself far too seriously the acting was awful seriously this is bad,negative
it did have some interesting points the characters well most of them were okay what special features does the dvd version have anyway stay away,negative
what is this its so bad the actors are awful they just cannot act to save their lives ive not heard of this film did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to dvd a girl got shot what is up with that it was just a stupid film its got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen i would definitely recommend to people to not waste their time with this well thats what i think of the film,negative
this movie was terrible i cannot recommend this movie where did this movie come from,negative
this film seemed to make up for the acting but not the special effects better on a big budget really this film could have been a good watch,negative
not sure about this character at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something,negative
we know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie a waste of time the premise was not too bad,negative
i saw this movie in new york city so i went across the street and saw the worst film of my life,negative
mr and leave me alone for once in your lives and i think mr please,negative
this is one of the worst films i have ever seen no matter how hard you try you couldnt care less about the characters,negative
i love all his work but this looks like nothing sorry,negative
you know i was very surprised when watching this movie this is by far the worst movie ever but to my surprise i kept watching its so bad its good enjoy,negative
we really dont know where to begin when talking about this movie but well start with the plot enough said we dont understand where this came from either and the music because it makes absolutely no sense and ive seen a lot of movies they will watch it and want to kill themselves do not watch,negative
its been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad one of the first scenes the one with the television show where the hell are you,negative
unfortunately this movie is so bad a joke is set up and given away,negative
because i would have never ever seen this movie through to the end,negative
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen its horrible,negative
the problems with this film are great in number i liked the general idea for the story kind of,negative
i am sorry to say that i wasted perfectly good money to buy the dvd of this movie,negative
it looked a lot like the effects your video camera does but you never use the hope that the rest just couldnt be that bad made me stay as is all of the above of course,negative
ok ill admit it im a huge fan of b movies and back then even the bad movies were still good,negative
most of the action was predictable and the characters were not very interesting i wanted to like this film but it just never happened,negative
it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie,negative
i wanted to like this movie but just could not find anything to like about it,negative
this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie ive ever seen what were they thinking whos the killer,negative
wait it turns oh my god look at its scary eye,negative
he seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny they didnt even do anything but sit around and laugh over and over,negative
and so it is here it is eventually just annoying,negative
which should i mention first its not interesting well i could but i wont since im such a nice guy even if it is from a film i very much enjoyed on that note theres one last thing id like to add that is something i never wish to experience again along with the film itself,negative
i feel for you i really do i thought sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie you know what,negative
she played that role and as you watched the movie you start to feel bad for her,negative
period what a waste of an hour and a half do not rent this movie,negative
you wouldnt think so but it actually for me in here no,negative
s the rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies i cannot recommend it,negative
but the rest was real bad so what happens what great thinking but not in a cool way,negative
if this isnt making much sense to you you understand,negative
this is a different story for better or worse the problem is that it just isnt a good movie in its own right,negative
but the team is really really terrible like beyond terrible but with a little work and team effort they try to give it their all even though that might turn into something more sad,negative
this movie is probably the worst ive ever seen anyway i did not like this movie now thats scary,negative
in scenes that had soundtrack music it was hard to hear the dialog the ending is really horrible too,negative
the first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny where was the editing but that acting was even better story who are the characters who are the bad guys are there good guys theres so much more but i hope ive done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie,negative
if theres one film you should avoid this is the one,negative
and finally on the third day i watched over an hour of the dumb thing and i didnt enjoy one single moment not even one oh boy,negative
you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film oh wait and the film isnt the only thing thats poorly written the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say one last thing,negative
this is it end of story the jokes are also completely lame this isnt just bad as in being a bad movie this this is thats how bad it is because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film,negative
but none of them is true film over all in all one of the most boring films i ever see,negative
the cinematography is poor and the acting even more so however i believe this movie is not worth watching for the average person,negative
it was simply boring to watch so much in fact i could just never really get into it of course it does not help this movie at all,negative
fans of this short of thing and apparently there are many will enjoy it others,negative
first thing first in this genre movie the first thing you need is a good music and thats where mr,negative
not really it may work for you it didnt for me,negative
in my opinion when the actors make you believe they are that person its a much more enjoyable movie,negative
but boy does it have a lot of problems s,negative
acting bad script bad director bad why come hero always have to dance to be success,negative
but there are not too many of them probably the worst major release film i have seen in my life definitely the worst for this year the problem is beyond all that he really did try,negative
the acting is pretty bad overall even for this sort of film overall i give this effort one star it has absolutely none of the elements that make a b movie fun to watch,negative
this movie could have been so much more i give this movie a low number it may not have been this low if i had not read the book,negative
he has a poor relationship with his only daughter theres not really anything funny here,negative
it had no direction a let down to its genre,negative
he did what he could as for the movie itself dont waste your time,negative
how do i begin thats how predictable this movie is and then comes the jokes please kill me now,negative
the simple plot is well simple the film looked a lot better without the effect,negative
if this premise were to work then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance,negative
bad move the mother gets ill with the problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have,negative
not any girl though the girl and then they got to stop him mostly less check and then special effects well there are some things that you might call effects theyre not very special though im not sure what to say about actors and characters like the poor effects or the poor budget well,negative
by the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was,negative
ok so this is horror lots of these around but i hope not well thats been done before too okay yes absolutely these are the things he wanted me to feel and i did would i see this again not ever,negative
and i feel this movie is awful the message is just too in your face ridiculous poor direction this movie needed more of an under score but instead it was as much in your face as the message was unfortunately it was not,negative
the main problems with this story there were too many to list all is that with this type of film you have to do two things ridiculous,negative
you wont be wrong a must watch film if only to laugh at how bad it is,negative
how can anyone even begin to like this film is really beyond me the idea it has none thats the idea now thats original and worth watching this this nothing it has nothing each and every shot is too long its so editing who needs that like hes acting that bad but this,negative
but i was wrong dont buy it dont rent it,negative
if there was better acting and a better script this could have turned out okay,negative
no real plot no storyline why is he there thats quite scary i guess but do i really care no i dont why dont i its nothing new i wish they wouldnt do that its done so many times its boring and gets predictable,negative
bad bad bad and its what is this country thinking dont waste time and money by seeing this,negative
in the end i was absolutely disappointed with this feature,negative
i actually enjoyed the special features on the dvd more than the movie itself,negative
its not that i dont like them just that i dont like them a lot there are some that i have enjoyed and some that i have thought were okay but nothing special dr it doesnt add much to the genre,negative
in the end it is not a horror movie but a horror of movie,negative
i mean what the hell were they thinking god help us all,negative
however the story was so very slow and boring i do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be and what a horrible story it tells,negative
this is by far the worst non english horror movie ive ever seen its not even scary,negative
the book was powerful still a nice tale for kids,negative
my friend made me watch this awful film it was so stupid i kept saying god turn it off,negative
what did you like about it no matter what you loved about it forget about all the rest its not worth talking about thats it,negative
but this wasnt it so overall its just lame weak call it what you will,negative
dont tell me this film was funny or a little funny after watching his performance all i can say is he is not made for movies,negative
this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen its not i rest my case do not pay any money to see this for making it,negative
hard to believe they meant a lot to each other,negative
if it isnt obvious this film didnt sit well with me that wasnt the case here,negative
the problem was not with the cast i think the cast was great lots of good talent lots of great acting but the script was terrible and that is what he does best but it just didnt work here this movie was full of problems and jokes that just didnt work it just made absolutely no sense as i said this movie was a big let down and i recommend you avoid it,negative
i give three stars for the acting performance one each,negative
this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film,negative
oh sure they eventually meet up in the end but it all seems rather was this interesting,negative
this movie is never funny i give this movie out of,negative
get it oh man dont get me started the plot is beyond ridiculous you dont think so ok lets go with that too in short no one could i hope he is anyway,negative
now this is what im talking about and what drama he does it and many people die a true movie watching experience a masterpiece,negative
god i love that man so much again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs,negative
but this is however not the case here it is much better to actually tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like because it seems as if they didnt even know what really happened it gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this,negative
im not so sure he could go that far i know once again that imdb is going to make me write ten more lines but im not so sure on what i could say about this movie because i am still trying to figure it out silly isnt it,negative
it didnt usually i think every movie has something that you can take from it this has nothing,negative
they ask why hollywood isnt making the money it used to,negative
wrong it just simply happens then nothing happens for an hour then something interesting happens and then it ends,negative
i dont know i dont know i dont know so here hes a cop,negative
the first major problem with this movie is the beginning,negative
and he was too it wasnt in her character and it just wasnt done by a lady of the those times no no no,negative
thats a problem i have with movies that come on television when there is nothing else to watch the story was stupid and he was the only funny character anyway,negative
so we know hes in the house what do you want who are you we have to understand that,negative
thats the mystery there is nothing enjoyable about this movie,negative
this movie was unfortunately terrible it is without a doubt one of the worst films i have seen in quite some time,negative
the rest of the cast is however bad the script has some nice ideas and the story is actually kind of interesting the final screenplay should have been re written a couple of more times though,negative
no question about that the acting is i would say good i recommend everyone to see this movie,negative
they should have left well enough alone there is not much here to recommend,negative
the acting is horrible the writing is horrible the direction if there even is any is horrible the camera work is horrible and the plot is horrible its a home movie,negative
the film does not work on any level and its boring on every level the film was made without any thought of making money because its just so bad,negative
or if he was at all the best line of the movie now that was funny,negative
and it looked like it was put together by the work experience kid,negative
that is the heart of this film he didnt make it,negative
how could you do this to me i cant believe it this movie is actually worse than the first one oh god where do i even begin dont even get me started on that horrible mess of a film or even back to the future,negative
cheap special effects even for the time although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them nothing to really recommend in this film,negative
i really did like this show once upon a time a he doesnt even mention work the animation is simply awful please,negative
this has got to be the worst piece of crap i have ever seen the original is a classic the island thing just didnt work lets hope there is not a third,negative
a short gone too far cant he just use his gun,negative
only a small child but its cool there like myself,negative
could i have ever been more wrong what is this no plot bad acting cheesy everything it couldnt get any worse,negative
the end seriously that is the entire plot to this movie i just wish i maybe had not have seen it but that is beyond the point certainly needed a lot more to be entertaining,negative
the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch in the end im not saying i can make a better movie than this but i am thinking it,negative
this just wasnt very much fun despite being funny at times,negative
b i thought it was very beautiful but somehow not part of the real world wrong actually has stars in her eyes when shes in love shes either miss or lady i couldnt even tell you what was said and done great drama,negative
the scenes at the end were good but they were not a part of the movie do not watch,negative
where this money was spent im not exactly sure let me see no not well no not really,negative
i saw this and since im a fan of violence and gore i got it you have plot also well the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it dont rent it it had its moments where it kept you going but im never going to see that film again,negative
it is a total waste of time and money everything in it is bad actors were bad script was really bad the story is stupid,negative
its a great comedy if nothing else ok it is nothing else,negative
but it does not work at all and then there is the acting and the plot and the sex it is not a good film it is a bad one but it is beautiful,negative
this has to be some of the worst direction ive seen,negative
i wont say this movie was bad but it wasnt good either this movie is a dream anyway i believe i wasted my time,negative
i was expecting a very funny movie instead i got a movie with a few funny jokes and many that just didnt work some of the things were funny i was expecting a more funny film,negative
its a shame because its one of those shows id love to love,negative
again terrible acting thats what i call acting again terrible acting,negative
what a cast and what a waste of it he is a good actor but in most roles he plays he always feels out of place perhaps it are his looks i dont known a too big mess to make you enjoy this movie,negative
or so i thought nothing like the game what the then this is for you,negative
its horrible so with three leads i liked this should have been fine it wasnt save your money dont watch this movie,negative
after such a film it would be enough to end her career,negative
now i could say some words but i will not,negative
do not see this film however this movie was terrible,negative
it is also not that bad not their best the storyline is ok and it is funny to watch it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again but if you are a young viewer this is a good movie then its ok,negative
dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with the acting it just really doesnt sound like much fun to watch and i tell you that it is not much fun to watch,negative
youve heard it said to live every moment as if its your last,negative
this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and so on,negative
it was a fantastic first effort in a movie the dog was also very good both did a great job with such awful material,negative
the movie has three story lines and none of them make sense or are they oh wait this movie was absolutely terrible,negative
the problem with this film is that the script becomes the story not characters or their lives now whats up with that,negative
let me see you should know that this isnt even high quality video yes youve seen it before but not like this yes ive seen bad acting the lead actor makes me ill true horror so rent this movie if you can find it,negative
i loved the original i watch it every year none of the other kids where in it it just could of been a lot better i dont know why they even tried to make this movie a really bad movie,negative
the story and acting are decent in my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie just dont expect a perfect production,negative
i saw it on video the actors are annoying to say the least,negative
this movie was awful i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through i didnt get the point of the movie what was the point of this movie i want those two hours back,negative
it was stupid stupid the acting is horrible but its what makes the movie so funny the love interest was hot,negative
i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first you dont have to know the first movie but we decided to stop after a good half an hour but what for but what for id really like to know no chance most of it wasnt funny at all at least for me what was the movie about anyway,negative
as for being a film the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible,negative
it was that bad i heard that they show dr the silly scenes were crap,negative
no body in their right mind should see this how could they think up something this bad even mystery men was better mystery men that movie wasnt worth being made complete waste of time,negative
there is no single scene i could laugh about but the game didnt make me laugh either but for me please please keep him from making more movies,negative
but every director once in a while in his career makes a bad film,negative
is this based on some comic book or something theres no sex no gore no nothing,negative
not scary interesting or much of anything unfortunately i still remember it the original didnt need a sequel not worth the effort,negative
the book was great it is easily the worst film i have ever seen wait a second isnt it british,negative
plot there really is none cast there is none period special effects absolutely awful in my opinion save your time money and chance something else you wont be disappointed,negative
id love to know what they were on when this film was being made,negative
im not going to say the story of the movie as some people do im pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is,negative
i had a video of the thing but give the man his due,negative
possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i wish i could say something nice like it was fun to make fun of this movie but this movie is giving me nothing to work with oh buy this movie and give it to people you hate,negative
its sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this,negative
im sorry but i dont think so i say no to this one,negative
thats about it that and of course no one scene can save an entire movie,negative
this is possibly the worst thing ive ever seen on television,negative
now about the movie itself i saw the original movie too and i also read the book the book i didnt like though but the movie yes,negative
am i the only one to think that this is a bad movie i admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects,negative
it would be great to see what these guys could do on a hollywood budget a classic,negative
there are a few laughs in the film but when you watch a comedy you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and thats all this film has going for it,negative
in all the episodes i never saw any real action or drama or comedy there is no drama what gives,negative
now what a cast the cast are mostly wasted in nothing roles,negative
ive just wasted my time and my money on this movie,negative
so were supposed to go along with this we had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making,negative
no money no acting no nothing this movie has nothing to recommend it i cant believe it ever got released to us television thats how bad this movie is,negative
i am a fan of his looked to be very low budget everything,negative
the film works hard maybe too hard for laughs i get where they were trying to go with this flick,negative
that said there was very little else here that worked,negative
i dont understand what people get out of by making this film or watching this film,negative
this sequel to problem child is just as bad as the first one to be bad,negative
i still dont understand what actually happened and i dont particularly care,negative
i hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again and ive seen a lot,negative
and i have seen a lot of films ill leave it at that,negative
the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too the movie is pretty slow too well thats just my opinion,negative
it was so terrible it wasnt fun to watch at all,negative
that is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent they dont say much but get shot at some point the dialogue is bad and the plot is worse,negative
really really bad how does a film this bad get made,negative
i do isnt that bad either okay cant say the same for here,negative
this is no different this not a bad thing she still looks great i would like to see her in a better movie,negative
but it has a few things going for it in a strange way it is actually quite funny simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly,negative
plot there was a plot thats about it run away now lots of them everyone has them,negative
very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel,negative
bad bad and did i mention bad read the script director,negative
this is few for such a long time i cant recommend this work,negative
id only check this one out if you love bad movies,negative
man i really wanted to like these shows the reason is simple,negative
unfortunately it had to be this movie what on earth do they have to do with this not much but a good cast of characters can save it right at least i know i would they might as well not even be there,negative
i have never seen a b movie like this one how bad is that it is bad for itself apart from that the whole movie is awful but if you have nothing to do go on,negative
i really wanted to love this film this film is very far from the book thats the point of the book it is a wonderful book dont waste your time buy the book,negative
youll tell us all the truth youll show us the light,negative
not always easy to figure out which side a character is on and whos doing what to whom,negative
how do stories this bad get made thats not a question here are my problems with the film but why what did it add to the story one way and then another and then another,negative
in the first hour or so nothing really happens who gets the guy for short i really didnt care what would happen with the main characters,negative
this was without a doubt the worst thing i have ever spent money on no no i see just watch the movie the acting the soundtrack the directing the dialogue the editing etc or perhaps they could release it as a documentary mr,negative
after reading through many of the reviews i dont know what movie some people were watching but clearly it wasnt the same one i saw this movie is horrible the woman cannot act at no point did she come across as the actual character so what do you do i not much i guess,negative
i guess some of the special effects were good but thats about it,negative
this film was the worst film i have ever seen it was a complete waste of money i really cannot think of one good thing to say about this film do not waste your money with this film there are many other better films out there,negative
if you havent already go see the original you wont be disappointed,negative
perhaps if you make into the second hour there is something worth seeing,negative
and something that i would not get made fun of for watching i did see some episodes i should really be shot for this and had to sit through the movie now where do i find a gun,negative
ive been on a bad run of films low budget i guess the plot could have been interesting it doesnt work,negative
even night of the living dead had better animation that said the movie had almost no plot why were they on that island in particular makes no sense in what could be called a b made for tv movie movie the acting was very good,negative
how can you go wrong how i am a man,negative
it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen and who will die there is no mystery or suspense,negative
watch this movie im not real hard to please but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the writing was just terrible at least her character was fun if not well written mr i take it back try to watch half of this movie then,negative
what the hell is she doing in a picture like this,negative
why he can do anything that cant be bad well no its not every one its not hard its not real there you go simple and still it gets worse thats the only reason it happens but no come on well they make the ending of the original look better how basically this film is just bad i really didnt want it to be bad but it is bad in just so many ways and thats what makes this so awful the worst film ever made maybe not quite,negative
while the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always there simply were too few of them,negative
i wish i could give it a dont waste your money or time on it thats saying something dont do it,negative
what in the world the supporting cast where are you,negative
i enjoy b movies i liked running time however i dont know if ill ever watch this movie again i got much less i do not recommend this movie,negative
this is the dream of some girls and good for them but after that,negative
the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the romance was not really romance,negative
just maybe someone would get it right this time around the horror scenes are a joke not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction the script the special effects and the camera work,negative
i just didnt get this movie was it a musical no was it a serious drama no the acting was not good enough for that but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse,negative
but had to see just how bad it could get all in all i would not recommend this movie,negative
sometimes its better to let the movie stand alone this is one of the others,negative
the characters are almost always the same and this time the story story youll know what will happen way before it happens,negative
this film was on late at night when i saw it i dont know anything about the man but it was quite entertaining,negative
the sad thing is this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot,negative
the not the best movie in the world you couldnt really make out what was going on i think if it wasnt as dark and you could see where they were then it might not have been so bad but not the suspense of how the movie is going to end but the suspense of forget this movie if you can see so anyway bad movie,negative
i wont add to the plot reviews its not very good,negative
this movie is bad the rest of the movie is horrible i think high school plays probably have better acting the plot makes no sense at all the set was pretty lame and it wasnt even good to make fun of it was just dull and very very bad it is the same sound every time,negative
never rent this this movie isnt of god its from hell,negative
in this she seemed to just turn up to read the lines still it was weak,negative
s theres no way that would happen like that thats it,negative
its hard and i didnt expect it but its really the worst film me and my wife saw poor special effects i think it would be a complete waste of time,negative
this is one of the best looking films of the past few years,negative
and it is absolutely not though its also written by him,negative
just dumb why god why all these people have much better talent now every time i see any of them i will think of this terrible movie,negative
this movie absolutely terrible but i was very wrong but no please no dont watch this movie,negative
first of all i realize that this is not a documentary that it is a drama the movie got that right i had never heard of this movie before seeing it etc they didnt happen,negative
some of their lines were funny some were stupid for the better,negative
so its just in case and oh my god yes theres another surprise youll never guess what dont watch this film,negative
so probably most worth looking for the two of them,negative
if violence is what you are looking for then there are lots of other movies out there,negative
this is supposed to be a horror movie come on hollywood you can do much much better,negative
whats wrong with it dont even get me started on the what the hell seriously do not waste your time with this one,negative
the sad thing is the movie has a really decent cast and crew stay away,negative
does it happen yes but not as often as one would think after having watched any of these movies pretty stupid but yes it happens sorry dont think so,negative
i dont believe they made this film the first film was okay but there was no need for a sequel certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film,negative
but get over it by then for most viewers it was too little too late,negative
well dont believe theres absolutely nothing good to say about this movie in fact there is,negative
only minutes later i was shown how poorly written this film was the last scene was probably one i will never forget and that isnt a good thing i dont understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie,negative
however i do think that there should be at least some point to the violence thats it i really cannot figure why the fact that the gore effects look realistic cannot be the reason i hope that makes the film look less realistic which is in this single case a good thing,negative
i couldnt get interested in the characters after watching this movie for an hour i turned it off,negative
well it wasnt just me none of my friends liked it either plus the soundtrack if you could even call it that was so annoying i cannot say enough to make people not waste their money,negative
i still think the directing and cinematography are excellent as is the music,negative
in the days before gore and sex took over real horror films were made i do not really know comments that is a shame for this one is a cut above the rest,negative
the movie has a not original premise but even though could be much better even the good cast is completely waste,negative
she starts playing around quite a bit although that part is not shown in this version,negative
ive done it many times over the years myself in many different ways,negative
the movie is far from funny and the story is ridiculous,negative
however it is interesting because it is a good example of how the good old days may not have been so good after all,negative
who lives like these characters i truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script it must have just been one whole joke to them on set,negative
it didnt happen hes always crazy and didnt bring anything to his role here hes just awful in this movie so is everyone else for that matter many left,negative
what another thing is that the movie extremely boring extremely what was the point of that to top it off the movie makes no sense and dont even get me started with the ending what exactly happened there yes its a message movie okay fun,negative
this has to be the best movie ever i love this movie it has to be the best movie ive ever put money down on,negative
poor man i admit i could not watch all of it too stupid for words,negative
does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all,negative
and it looked decent unfortunately this was not good stuff well no sure you get a monster fight at the end not exactly my idea of a good time,negative
sometimes i think im going out of my mind she tells her husband,negative
they are all horrible it is really bad worst dialogue ever the whole movie was awful horrible,negative
her acting is weak not very good at anything the only good thing is the music youre my love was the best in the soundtrack,negative
he did it i mean come on thinking about how much money this movie will bring in if you must see it,negative
however i must say now that i was somewhat disappointed,negative
many times you could not make out the dialog over the background music,negative
the first half of the film had next to no dialog there are some good things going on in the film the soundtrack was well done,negative
i wish he would just move there thats working class right there i sure cant wait for his dvd set to come out,negative
dont watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie,negative
until than the killer had only killed women oh well i guess it wasnt as predictable as i thought,negative
then things should turn around within the next day or so he has kids he tells his wife that hes found god and thats good enough for her final moment man this movie is bad thats good enough but no thats about it look everything seems so beautiful,negative
the acting is second rate it sounds nothing like an true english woman the other characters are no better how are we to supposed to care about these people really the script was awful as was the acting,negative
all around no classic but its not the worst of its kind either out of,negative
why why it will only make you sad for them,negative
i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work at least it was interesting,negative
at most we get lost why are we here where are we how did we get here,negative
so you can imagine how little money was spent making it this film has none,negative
i am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets,negative
this is the single worst movie i have ever seen then by the end i wanted to kill myself it would have made it better to have not seen any of the horror,negative
i had to comment on how disappointed i was when i saw it,negative
did you find the title funny oh you didnt now do you find it funny still no still no ok thats it why else would you not laugh oh its not funny no this cant be why please please ok thats it i need to write some jokes for my show and scene im not even saying this because i hate him im for real i even tried watching his show i told myself maybe he isnt that bad but no he is before i knew it the show was over,negative
its not like i was expecting a good film this did not even do that,negative
i think its a great movie i would like to see it again if they were showing it in tv,negative
did you even screen this movie and the movie ends oh wait at the end of the movie,negative
hard it was just stupid with a terrible ending i love a really cheesy horror flick but this was terrible,negative
i could have told someone how it would end once i got through the first ten minutes,negative
oh man where to even begin i could go one for a few more hours but you get the point,negative
why is the script so bad the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting is he done yet its just bad why is she not present here over all this movie is just bad,negative
why have you come to this well i miss call too,negative
they could have done better the whole story was bad you give that great movie a bad name how old is this girl how about making this movie a little believable,negative
when was this movie made ill talk to you about it later that line was just classic just like a man whatever,negative
as for the story well im not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth,negative
some of the space effects were quite good but others were cheesy,negative
if so they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down,negative
this move is terrible the acting was terrible too do not see this movie,negative
there isnt one decent scene the two other girls are terrible as well then the dialogue is also crap lame s what and we dont even see the sex either stupid did the writer even see the first film the end interesting,negative
if this ever happens to you in real life dont do it,negative
this film is not a good film at all particularly i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this i thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book,negative
thats the only decent i can find to say about the movie so i thought i would get it out of the way right up front how does that work on the way back but still message coming in,negative
ever i dont care if the other episodes may or may not be better than this no one should be forced to watch this crap,negative
but that is not the only comment i they show almost nothing this is a thought i have about the movie not about people,negative
quite different from the hollywood version which shows her shot at the end,negative
i wont waste your time with the plot you may read other reviews,negative
it is so sad i like the brother and sister in this movie,negative
definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life she was really that annoying,negative
but this is of interest only as a period piece,negative
first of all its just too much to take in a dramatic movie,negative
this is among my ten worst films of all time,negative
how and of course both want to have her as girlfriend wife how silly how stupid the movie ends on a very dumb note indeed,negative
this film had no middle to it lets put the bad points to one side,negative
please take my word for this i am a huge fan of the war genre and this movie is crap,negative
simply put nothing happens in the film but it takes a long time getting to that nothing there isnt even one good word i can say about this film,negative
the good earth is perhaps the most boring film ive seen in my life,negative
and i must say it was bad yes you heard it the animation its quality was only as high as the tv series something which i did not expect at all the next was the absolutely horrible voice acting next was the horrible script they try to put some jokes in but i just found them annoying seriously how many other movies has used that ending already,negative
what can you say about this movie it was not terrible but it was not good the story was silly and the acting was ok it was not very well cast either would i recommend this movie i think this is where this movie was trying to go but never got there,negative
it is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it imdb ten now what went wrong a t sometimes it is just better to leave things alone,negative
wait for it to come on tv before you see it,negative
about the story telling at the end of it all you end up giving some credits to the director,negative
first of all there is such a thing as the art of cinematography theres nothing real in this film sorry but this is not good writing or good directing,negative
three what the first novel is time at the top the second is all in good time,negative
i didnt expect id to be able to stay in the room while it was on,negative
theres absolutely nothing that makes sense here and i even doubt there ever was a script to work with but somehow i couldnt turn it off great move,negative
the opening scene really got me into watching the movie but i guess anything is possible,negative
this movie starts really good this movie starts really good,negative
i am a fan of the previous best of the best films but this one was awful the acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as well john,negative
well just awful can we talk please please no sequel,negative
this movie is by far the worst movie ever made,negative
well maybe in this case could you not take this idea and run with it,negative
if i could i could turn back time i would why what is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last a man who cannot act it did not the jokes are dead even before they are told i dont think ill ever hate anything more than this,negative
because it was original new and went beyond anything thats ever been done because at least it made sense,negative
a complete waste of time and nothing what i expected it to be in short do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case,negative
the director and writers must understand what the original tv show was really about as well as who the characters were and how they worked and there were characters who did get killed although most were bad guys so i will close with the point being made that i didnt enjoy this movie,negative
ok from the start the first couple of series were quite good as said earlier it started well but went on way too long,negative
even the cover of the dvd looked good as soon as i started watching it i was thinking like others oh my god whats this nothing against the music itself it was just in the wrong parts of the movie that would have been more interesting but it didnt happen another reason i was disappointed was the plot made no sense there was no mention in this movie about it being a true story,negative
so he does now let me tell you about the major plot michael is a completely different person s,negative
i do not find this show at all funny there both really stupid and just terrible actors the whole premise of the show is a stupid idea although i can say as much as the first season is clearly better than the second,negative
there have been so many many films based on the same theme this has been done many times but despite this i was still looking forward to it this was none of these,negative
is this a film comedy but it actually does not,negative
run kids take the title role you have to see the ending to understand this point where were the parents,negative
this is one of the most god awful movies ever this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back i will make fun of this movie until i die and then some it is so horrible it is not even funny,negative
oh where to start what will happen well but oh no enjoy,negative
this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year no sex but just about everything else gay they become great friends,negative
this was the worst acted movie ive ever seen in my life no really but the acting,negative
or some such time after not seeing it for many years i decided to see if i could find it on dvd,negative
poor acting even worse writing this show was just bad,negative
character development was awful etc etc cant believe i watched the whole thing,negative
it can idea is good but script and story itself is terrible why nothing these two are not meant to be together i would give three stars but i doubt movie deserves a one,negative
if this kind of a movie is set in us it will sure make itself a big joke but no,negative
lets just say that it might be the worst movie ive ever seen,negative
even though yes im not sure what i really didnt like about the movie even though i loved american beauty but that was it it was a big waste of my time and dont say because it was a good movie,negative
what an awful movie this is truly one of the worst films ever made,negative
what the hell try again and thats saying something dont watch this movie,negative
he does not work anything out it just comes to him when in doubt hes going after the first lady,negative
everything is as real as can be it is very beautiful and real but why do we see it is it because of the songs is it because of the nature there is no beginning or end to it why was this movie made i am sorry,negative
my wife and i thought that with this cast and director the movie would have to be at least worth watching we were wrong,negative
this one got nothing of it theres no suspense oh my god ok too bad to be true,negative
this movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man,negative
the only thing that is decent with this movie is the soundtrack maybe,negative
well its beautiful thats about the best i can say for it i didnt like it any better for that,negative
nor is it terrible most of them were enjoyable over the top the story had a few interesting ideas enough to keep me watching it to the end,negative
this movie is a joke why why why why thats what i thought,negative
this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen she can really hear something,negative
the other performances are nothing to write home about either,negative
possibly its down to the fact that hot dog it looks cheap and isnt funny,negative
that anyone really wanted to see this s they gave some fun okay okay so you have to see for yourself no probably the worst one i have ever seen,negative
and i can see why how true what an awful movie,negative
and it all just seemed to be out of place it had its moments why did the characters do this i am so disappointed,negative
so much could have been done with this premise and i really was expecting creepy things to happen it would have been nice if more background was given on the characters of course this is part of the mystery,negative
i found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play,negative
horror there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film this film doesnt have one in the horror genre in general and in this film in particular,negative
everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense,negative
something to note though what did i miss avoid unless for laughs,negative
can i just start by saying im a fan of bad movies and this is a really bad movie,negative
well you know the story was lame and the script was just terrible the poor actors didnt have material to work with you would expect something like top gun as i said the story was lame with a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting,negative
i absolutely love the first three movies they were great,negative
all the other comments already said what i was going to say here goes anyway who did that song about dr i thought the doctor directing the battle scene was never going to end,negative
i hate this show if people like it then keep it on,negative
this is a total piece of crap the acting is average to bad it was at least somewhat true to the book which i really love,negative
but it fails at making them laugh then comes the sequel where do you think he found the money and fails,negative
even though i watched the whole thing i wasnt made to care even for a moment about either of them,negative
i really wanted to like this but in the end its a poorly made film with too few laughs who knows but thats just me,negative
and that doesnt call for a two plus hour movie,negative
there is nothing unique in either the tv series nor the movie i didnt,negative
what a waste i usually like b movies some of them are actually quite good but this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny,negative
it just didnt stand out at all really mr it just didnt live up very very very nice to see something good for a change its getting a little old sorry,negative
there is no point in even writing about what is in the film as that has already been done,negative
i am a scary movies fan the end is oh you will be really really surprised not possible yes it is,negative
annoying what else i only directed short films but im pretty sure id be way better than that directing a feature film,negative
where do they get the money to make films like this,negative
really i felt nothing but when i saw it on stage i felt everything,negative
in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me,negative
his relationship with his daughter that was so realistic i do not think so and why is that well its not a comedy movie no its a horror one name good thing about it may god help you,negative
it was so bad i am so disappointed why would i even say that,negative
how the hell did they get this made awful then i would pay to see it,negative
if you tried to make a bad film you could not make one worst that this one,negative
im a wife im a mother i have a real life look at what were doing here and this movie definitely brought it up the movie is not,negative
when i watched the movie i got the feeling that i had seen most of this in other better movies sound silly,negative
i just couldnt watch it i just dont get how you can love that kind of movies and thats not a good enough reason i think but well i guess i will never understand that kind of films,negative
how cool is that i really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress,negative
much worse than the original watch the television show instead its much better,negative
what is love what do i do but what we get is something very very different,negative
it is like a documentary film but not as good as a documentary because it is no documentary i do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny the film is quite boring,negative
as far as mr because in that case you might find this film an oscar level material,negative
for one the cast is nothing special the worst part though is that this film is boring no really im not making this up there it is now i didnt see anything let me guess then were back to the dialog run around dialog is not a bad thing but thats all this film has characters talking that too is not a bad thing except this film isnt very good at it it makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or was,negative
one who has never seen a movie before its fantastic and i dont think hell ever top it,negative
actually i think it didnt help that the mystery wasnt very good so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep you watching,negative
it is bad bad bad bad there is no plot i really enjoy his other films but if youre a fan like me stay away from this one,negative
the first home alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting it almost makes up for it by using some pretty good non original music but its just not the same and it doesnt work i could follow it but i doubt a kid could i recommend this to huge fans of the series only,negative
this movie is awful they were also very very bad none of these things were there all in all a very bad made for tv movie experience,negative
i should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here though its a low budget movie it could have been made better without any acting all the characters where just moving or doing like kids,negative
this movie is not realistic at all more of a comedy than a serious war film something must be wrong,negative
bad script bad directing bad acting bad editing bad sound and bad music get the idea the actors try there best and my heart goes out to them,negative
i had the feeling throughout the movie that id seen this before,negative
i was also a great fan of a similar movie history of the world,negative
dont waste your time you will not say its so bad its good just its bad they just stop there to let off the writer,negative
i cant believe ive just spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film if there is only one film you have to miss this is the one the plot is particularly weak so i really cant comment on acting here maybe this is the only good thing,negative
but they turned out giving us the worst of the series and thats saying a lot,negative
this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made thats really a not,negative
but lets try anyway dont ask how not important dont watch this movie,negative
lets get one thing out of the way i wish i could say the same about this movie the whole idea is dumb,negative
the plot with the gun is of course pretty boring,negative
there are lots of songs perhaps too many but few of them are especially memorable,negative
the acting was the worst ive seen in a long time this film feels like youre watching the home movie of someone who doesnt get out much,negative
all in all its very predictable that means that our mr these things are funny to watch however she looked like she had a bad run in with some white face the script is bad and cheesy other than that dont waste your time and money,negative
it wouldnt have been hard to make this premise interesting either try not to see this movie total waste of time,negative
wait dont tell me i though it was him talking its about looks and its about the money well all in all i think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made,negative
it wasnt even scary next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead people the last one was the best it wasnt that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cool the end,negative
i wanted those hours of my life back and where do i begin the dumb a kids in the movie but what do you expect,negative
the reason for this is its not very good it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema,negative
this is one of the worse movies that i have ever seen in my entire life,negative
please do not waste any money on this movie the world would be a better place without this film,negative
its so wrong in so many ways i dont where to begin so lets see why oh but why why then why do we need this kind of stuff then the suspense but no then the actors,negative
i have not seen it yet and at this rate i dont think that i ever will,negative
the movie had no real plot do not waste your money on it,negative
or is he of course not just like that its simply over their version appears to have the ending either cut out completely or this is how it ends yes this film is that bad im not sure a film like this could be made today with not one reason to care about anyone or anything in this,negative
final score they can now say we dont need you tv fans we have reality shows the show itself is a joke,negative
i was wrong no from one human being to another please,negative
there are far better shows for your kids to watch,negative
elements of the story are sound true well done i wonder what that means maybe she did some set work why didnt they get this right it could have been good,negative
this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller,negative
from hell oh and out of interest there were no special effects,negative
ive never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production,negative
crap crap done poorly there is no real mystery to the plot i love black comedy but this film isnt funny there are many films in this genre which are much more entertaining,negative
first off im not here to dog this movie i havent decided which remember you cant help but feel sorry for it well its not human all in all,negative
do you actually have to try to do that no real characters etc just dull,negative
i absolutely love the show its possibly the best show ever i get the whole you never stop fighting but it was stupid to end it right in the middle,negative
and not even in a so bad its good way,negative
watched the directors cut last night just black and just white boring,negative
its a bad thing children a very bad thing if you enjoy bad movies go for it,negative
why so what is their problem when it comes to the movies they are excellent movies they are all enjoyable and fun to watch this wouldnt have been a problem except for one thing possibly the fans but im sure not the parents then theres the theme song it was fun and enjoyable nice music fun to watch whatever some pretty funny lines,negative
and finally the end but only cast cant save a movie,negative
well just awful can we talk please please no sequel,negative
those good things i heard were all wrong very wrong this flick is bad and i mean bad everything about it,negative
this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie but its something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about its now a running joke among my friends and i,negative
was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama fine fine fine but by now its too late,negative
well until you meet the characters then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour,negative
this was an awful movie s very bad film with a made for tv feel to it,negative
this was god awful too bad his acting did nothing for me,negative
actually i didnt really expect this film to be much good so why did i watch it,negative
give me a break more like a comedy than a horror movie if you want a laugh rent this if you truly want a horror movie stay the hell away from this one,negative
however i am a die hard horror fan and will give just about any horror movie a chance not here sorry there is a man who knows old school horror,negative
remember that name you cant get much worse than this movie,negative
from this awful movie there are so many things wrong with this film acting writing direction editing etc the music,negative
bad idea this is one of the times when if you dont have something nice to say you should get the word out,negative
i very much doubt thats the point the movie meant to make,negative
give a such budget to make this the better things in this film was the word end too bad,negative
then the music starts it didnt get much better ill tell you why with bad songs not me i have more important things to do im sure you do too,negative
i thought the camera wasnt bad at all for a cheap movie like this and also the atmosphere wasnt too bad although i do think that about a lot of movies in this case it was horrible of course the acting was bad but ive seen worse the movie was bad but ive seen worse,negative
this movie was not very good in my opinion the overall writing and acting were very weak also making the game play by itself was very weak writing why do you even need the game if you know someone like that you can watch it with at laugh at do it otherwise stay far far away,negative
i have never seen such a terrible movie in my life,negative
music is interesting but little else if if you like french movies,negative
in the end the acting was what came through and not the plot the ending scene was particularly good but i am not one to give it away although others may find this movie good i was one who found it so so,negative
i thought it was the most horrible movie ever made,negative
and most of the time it wasnt even all that scary that was such a stupid twist all in all its difficult to feel for characters that you know from minute one are going to die all in the same way and theres nothing they can do its just boring because you know whats going to happen,negative
not only did he leave the plot behind he made up his own,negative
before i saw this sequel i had heard that it was a terrible film however be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if its not as good as the original the best performance is given by the rock and its nice to see him in a different type of role his performance is kind of dull though sometimes the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny,negative
far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script if you want to watch something about this period watch anything but this,negative
how long i could talk about them if youre a fan of bad movies to laugh about you have to see it,negative
i will admit that i did not give this movie much of a chance i decided pretty early on that this just wasnt my kind of movie,negative
this movie has a few good performances going for it and thats all it has going for it the material that is the problem the writing is just awful its amazing that the cast could come off as well as they did as the dialogue is dull at best come on,negative
but the good die young and then while i will admit to laugh at least a few times so yes,negative
mr i couldnt even watch the entire film well at least the acting was good not,negative
the girls part was pretty good i find the plot a little hard to believe of course he was a friend of her brother sure there were some things i liked about it i cant imagine watching it again but it is worth seeing once,negative
and it is badly made this is not the worst horror movie i have ever seen but it still is a bad one,negative
maybe they wanted to show how evil he was but it was a stupid idea give me a break awful,negative
is this the same man who directed the last picture show too bad,negative
sorry to say but was disappointed in the film not only that this movie is boring it all looks put on what about that laugh of his,negative
no wonder this movie never saw the light of day did he really think we even wanted to know about his life,negative
did i already mention how bad it was stay away by all means,negative
seriously ive read some of the reviews on this film and i have to ask were you people watching the same movie,negative
is there anything new inside without it can be done what a crap this is simply nothing,negative
but i didnt you must see her then it doesnt make sense but it gets worse i thought great thats all you need to know,negative
its just bad a few scenes are ok but in whole its a mess,negative
watching the movie im not surprised almost nothing happens in the movie,negative
i couldnt the special effects were awful thats where i had to stop avoid,negative
the director may have been making a point about death but only he knows what it is give it a miss,negative
did everyone follow that also most of the cast tries really hard the rest of the cast is also fine,negative
its a good movie to watch when you dont have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once but even then its not so good either,negative
it is hard enough to make any book into a movie,negative
five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before and there are no new elements here,negative
this was however simply the worst movie i have ever seen there is none how do movies like this ever get made this is no budget film making at its very very worst,negative
im watching this film as i write this how did this ever get made,negative
good or bad the cast of actors are terrible the rest of the cast kill the show it is the same story line in every episode this is every episode might have been funny then my god,negative
not that the story was that bad i guess you could say i had some problems with the script i thats about all that i can find good to say about this picture,negative
but even then the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told please dont watch it even if other people say its good because it isnt,negative
then the two women went to the performance late at night i still have no idea what theyre saying not real or is it real,negative
i have done quite a few reviews on imdb and this film is unique in that i never saw the entire movie in other words the better his movie the less of him you see in the film and this is funny in what way,negative
just a few words its like those tv movies with bad cast and plot,negative
this movie starts out very very slow but when the action finally gets started its a little had to follow i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script,negative
this film has its heart in the right place but unfortunately it isnt much of a film,negative
they looked quite wonderful but that was it they were not given any characters or good lines to work with,negative
the movie starts good it has a thing going for it so what i hope i never see this kid in another movie again its a waste of time watching this movie boring piece of well the number is killing him give me a break,negative
i was truly disappointed it was the worst crap ive ever seen what were you thinking making three hours out of it it may have a quite good story but actors no suspense no romance no horror no it didnt have anything not real at all it was a total waste of time,negative
but other than that nothing else was worth my time,negative
oh god where to begin bad acting characters you just dont care about are they american or british so what do they do so what do they do,negative
got that there were a few cheap laughs very few but it was lame he wasted his money,negative
i go to the cinema to see the stars i dont want the audience directing the movie maybe he isnt,negative
if you havent read the book then expect a decent tv movie with a good acting cast if you have read the book then try and forget it when watching this,negative
nothing makes sense in this movie it would really take too long to mention all the plot problems from now on i will check imdb before watching any film,negative
so why exactly did i hate it so much but wait it gets a lot worse,negative
i went to see this in the theater when it came out,negative
and not in a fun to watch way its just bad,negative
this subject has been done to death we get it we get that too,negative
good movies so what do they do they create a new one,negative
wrong its just dumb no one and no one does anything believable or interesting,negative
bad idea the characters where not very realistic when it came to reality,negative
why back to the film or else what exactly dont ask me how that works or the film having a big budget their own free will,negative
actually there are so many bad parts i cant make up my mind which is the worst i cant believe anyone actually put up the money to have this thing made,negative
this does give away some of the plot by the way this however does not what,negative
keep in mind that this is a short very short,negative
this movie made a big joke out of them its like they were trying to be serious in the beginning then their writers got high and gave up,negative
if you avoid seeing one film this year make it this one,negative
i mean i thought i heard this dialog in the movie but it was so bad and out of place that i cant really believe it am i crazy,negative
easily one of the worst films ever made for anyone who doesnt know anything it seems as though these people had no idea this is how films work,negative
dont take that mean that its so bad that its good because its not its a total waste of time and money they figure if they think its funny then everyone will think its funny well theyre wrong if these people could get their movie made and released on dvd then anyone can,negative
time has not been kind to it he does this over and over and over and so on still its ok,negative
i did here this movie was good from various people yet he did not become what he needed to be to make this movie good the directing was just horrible in this movie thinking ok why should i care about any of this,negative
since these are not characters in this story its hard to comment on the actual film and thats not hard to do here goes thats ok though i wonder why hes bad no job song and dance what this guy is above that its true,negative
am i acting as if something were wrong s the direction deserves a few comments i wonder why its there just as i wonder why the rest of the movie is there never mind nothing like it had ever been done before im not making that up so who was it made for id have to guess kids who are too young to know about the original and who dont like movies in black and white,negative
it disappointed on every level the rest of the cast isnt much better,negative
this in my opinion is very stupid i did not like it all it does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesnt make much sense so just avoid this movie,negative
run run far away i didnt want to watch the rest of this film but i felt i should if i wanted to give a review of this movie,negative
its just a bad film i but bad the acting was way off then on then going way way way off,negative
first there are awful movies then there are the worst movie ever what next and no please no,negative
this movie is slow boring and a waste of time,negative
whatever it is that i watched it certainly didnt feel like a movie avoid,negative
its not the same as the classic line up this film would have been better off never being released,negative
now go watch it and then you tell me what you think,negative
im sorry to myself you know why most movies now even this bad ones it was poorly written poorly directed poorly shot and definitely poorly acted just dont,negative
and you got to love these lines they use is anyone there who is out there this isnt funny no but your acting was,negative
overall this film is about as scary as home alone,negative
well its really a lot of fun to watch because while watching this you think to yourself did the director really make this seriously,negative
the first scene sets up the overall atmosphere of the entire movie,negative
it is without doubt one of the worst films ive ever seen the poor and everyone else,negative
this film is totally crap but a very big crap,negative
character needs a gun gets a gun cant do that because he has a gun oh my god what are we going to do he has a gun it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do really who needs that,negative
there is no plot there is no character development this movie is a waste of time,negative
they were all straight to video films and i was right who really didnt get many big roles apart from those two films and i dont see why hes not too bad an actor and is pretty fun and theyre not evil this time either did they,negative
cinematography but why stop there the plot is just poor dialog is the less said the better characters dont get me started the more you think about this the worse it gets,negative
saw this movie when i was a kid the screenplay is terrible the editing even more nothing special about the music could have been a lot more better,negative
an interesting one but not enough to make this a good movie,negative
that would have been a movie worth seeing hes not he can be,negative
actually i watched all of the movie the box read like the it would be really funny the premise of the movie sound good jack black is funny how could this movie miss well it does miss it is just a really lame movie,negative
stay far away from this film so lets get down to the problems,negative
im sorry but this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen,negative
you might not love the character but you should care what happens to him the whole thing just didnt work next,negative
i really like his movies even the soundtrack was very annoying,negative
what else is wrong with this film a real shame what else is wrong what else is wrong with it,negative
i can always tell when something is going to be a hit i see it or hear it and get a good feeling,negative
why well it is true that the main idea is similar and they kill women it was just all too much too much sex too much violence there was nothing that i could do with this film there was simply nothing about it to think about other than why did they make this terrible film if they wanted to say anything at all it just didnt work,negative
nothing else is good about this movie we lost it no sorry it was still bad make it a point to miss this one,negative
the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing so what was the story line what was with the girl was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film kid said it was stupid and he was four years old i did love the theme song,negative
the children the father i have heard it all before scary no are there men writing that figure that women should be so annoying what i really want to know is why do they get the money,negative
bad bad bad how do movies like this get made,negative
oh well i thought it wasnt all a waste he really deserves much better though,negative
so what is it about this film that makes it so poor is it the story yes is it the actors yes it it the whole look and feel of the movie yes to start off with the story my god in this case not even close baby they look even more out of place than the actors if this is possible,negative
a well not the men who made this movie at any rate,negative
this movie is so bad its almost good bad story bad acting bad music you name it,negative
now that would have been interesting this one made me wish i could get my money back,negative
i cant even come up with many of those so bad its good kind of moments,negative
whatever just watch it if you want but if you dont,negative
this movie is not so good as i thought it would be,negative
a and yet and yet i say it because its true well lots of things could be better but anyway this is still good stuff oh well you cant have everything,negative
this movie was one of the worst ive ever seen just terrible,negative
or better still read the book it will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie,negative
why would anyone want to act for the art t she looks horrible the songs can you believe that she should have done it,negative
the first fight scene was pretty cool i dont see it though nice idea i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone,negative
but the show my god the show was bad never again never again,negative
however they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes theyre still a bit dull though,negative
dont ask me why he does it a bad bad movie overall,negative
this movie is so bad i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person,negative
one gets the feeling with this film that we have seen him and it done all before,negative
the problem really became reality got lost on this show,negative
surprise really sad its hard to find things to say about this a must see movie to believe,negative
not good just awful i cant think of anything more to say which is how i got it then,negative
this was the worst movie i have ever seen bad acting bad effects bad script bad everything why im supposed to feel sorry for this guy,negative
if you ever decided to waste your money on this film dont,negative
the day after it seems like some kind of weird dream did i really see what i thought i saw,negative
i have to say that i used to be a huge fan of the series it is a shame since this was a great series and it just keeps getting worse i know they are made for dvd films but some effort would be nice,negative
where well see thats right another movie that makes absolutely no sense the plot seems simple enough i have no idea what happened and that was before the title screen he gets lost and then finds his way back then they leave theres really no point to this scene wait seriously,negative
but i was dumb that day because i did something i should have never done now to the review and then at the end it is quite funny though,negative
and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me what a horrible experience first off i hate the new characters so stupid i hate this show,negative
oh my god it just doesnt get any worse than this what were these people thinking no probably not,negative
actually had to stop it dont get me wrong love bad monster movies,negative
each genre has its best and worst films is there a love story between them,negative
has the writer been living under a rock its terrible,negative
but this was just so incredibly annoying he brought nothing new or interesting,negative
doesnt opening credits what where they thinking none for no reason s movie good for you,negative
i saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then since i had read the book several times,negative
i wish i had not wasted my time to watch this movie,negative
you dont get to the point where you care ive read a lot of the comments here about how the movie didnt know what it wanted to be etc theres just not enough to it to waste the time as for best film ever made its not even the best film ive watched today,negative
it didnt work and thats the problem why thats not funny dr but even seeing those moments again didnt save the episode worst episode ever,negative
i guess they didnt know either dont take your kids to see dont rent the dvd,negative
now do you need to know more if not then youll probably enjoy it,negative
why make fun of people just stop making fun of the people,negative
no he seems to be in another country this was extremely poorly made even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit not one of the other actors here ever made anything else memorable nothing else in the movie is worth watching,negative
cool music bad acting poor writing all came together for my entertainment i dont care what happened to any of the characters they were all boring and stupid so lets review,negative
come on fantastic drama on screen where did these people learn acting terrible plot awful acting what can i say more to say what ok you want it you got it,negative
just looking at the premise of the story the story is horrible its just not worth it,negative
is it just me or is this an awful film im going with its an awful film if i cant somehow believe in the premise the film will not work surprise yes it really is that simple and that dumb save your money,negative
my wife and i saw every episode in this series and loved it a waste of great writing and acting,negative
s it just isnt even close to being the same thing s,negative
the evil dead i think all i have to do is just type the name again because come on its the evil dead oh,negative
it sounds stupid even when you think about it i found it better than the first one havent watched the second yet just dont rent it,negative
thats what happens with this film this is not his best work,negative
i know its not its not good boring dull otherwise its just a stupid film,negative
the first scary movie was a laugh a minute film the script needed a lot more time to age,negative
i think one should not waste his her time watching this movie i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but dont watch this waste of time,negative
the perfect murder almost one last question for mr so not done,negative
what movie is this it just goes like this how boring the songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie,negative
the movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible,negative
and now this how stupid they think we are really oh my god they just said it,negative
i actually went to see this film in a theater but what a complete waste of time and money they had really enjoyed the book so the movie just had to be perfect,negative
wrong its bad as anything can be there is so much to laugh at and its not the jokes,negative
ok i watch a lot of bad movies but this movie is one of the worst i have watched i like a good horror movie the opening scenes seemed pretty good,negative
just horrible they change the ending they change the plot even if you are not stay away this movie is my least favorite film of all time,negative
it wasnt great but then it was a strange role,negative
the problem is this film is as awful as the first two,negative
a ten year old might like it and so it goes all the way also the so called great effects were terrible,negative
but other than that i cant really recommend this movie,negative
and a genre that has been done so much better before with so much real talent out there im really surprised this movie ever got made,negative
and dont even get me started on that terrible twist ending,negative
my four year old found one scene funny but told me the rest of it was too silly this,negative
the film is bad there is no other way to say it what was he thinking it didnt work it didnt even seem to make sense really boring dont see it,negative
just read through the other comments here and was a little surprised to find that no one had said anything about the acting or plot great actors they are not enough about that as for the plot oh man oh,negative
i think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie i loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out,negative
ive seen all four of the movies in this series this is the worst one yet the entire story line is no where in the book if you want a good family movie this might do i hope that this will be the last movie from this series but i doubt it,negative
i was in the theater scene it is more of a comedy than a horror movie but for a good laugh you might want to check it out,negative
now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad where the hell did this come from what the hell is this crap classic hollywood,negative
by the way dont you think hes a little old for her,negative
i am truly sad that this is the first bad review ive ever made for a movie ever i could stand to watch this movie and it is the second movie in all the movies ive seen that is just it was like if must fight and then the credits hit the screen,negative
my feeling was this was filmed in a day please tell me it was,negative
finally all is worked out but it still makes no sense,negative
this movie was exactly what i expected not great but also not that bad either what i did like was the special effects,negative
i saw the movie last night here at home but i thought it was too long first of all,negative
god just a little bit more than it took me in case of alone in the dark,negative
this movie is hilarious the problem is that its not a comedy,negative
i havent seen this movie since it came out nor do i wish to see it again this is basically just another,negative
it takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end and i thought hero was bad,negative
the problem is the monster or lack of it there were some scenes i liked such as when one girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster is coming towards her,negative
so back to the movie i never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good,negative
from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction sure now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you,negative
the first part is better with roles for what seems to be every third rate character actress working in hollywood at the time shes pretty certainly shes always fun though this movie made me wonder if a little of her doesnt go quite a long way as a comic,negative
did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing,negative
where can you go wrong watch the movie and youll find out to top it off the plot is pretty stupid,negative
and last and least theres an awful song played during the credits,negative
there are so many ways that this movie is bad are found if this movie was made on a low budget it shows i dont mean that i liked the ending i didnt i just liked the fact that it was over in my opinion dont waste your time on this one,negative
yes it could im not even going to waste more words on this movie,negative
basically they should look sound and feel dont get me wrong,negative
one of the worst movies i ever saw the acting was terrible i felt sorry for the actors that they couldnt find something better to do with their time the story was ridiculous,negative
some of the actors are terrible its not very well written either i love to watch it to laugh at it you know the saying its so bad that its good i also like to watch just to see if im right when i guess how its all going to end so far ive been right every time its like a little game that i play,negative
s if your not happy all the time you are a bad person not a good message at all no of course not just use this and finally,negative
yes this film is also about a sort of living dead,negative
the cinematography was good first of all hes a black guy,negative
a made for tv thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them,negative
i couldnt wait for the end this is absolutely the worst film i have ever seen,negative
some funny parts in it very few and too long the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me,negative
ok the story is nice to begin with well at least theres a happy ending,negative
we already have enough of this and we want something new big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time not behind,negative
thats the main thing the actors did pretty well but it wasnt up to them save this bunch of crap a few jokes were funny but most were bad and cheesy couldnt wait to get out of the theater want my money back,negative
now ive seen a lot of bad movies i like bad movies especially bad action movies the plot is bad the script is bad the sets are bad it didnt help much but it was better than nothing,negative
but who is the father its a terrible storyline its not funny ever but its meant to be,negative
this movie was terrible it is not something that people should have to pay to see i thought i was going to a sci fi movie avoid it,negative
i have seen the last three and enjoyed them it worked against it i work in the business of film and television,negative
i just watched it a couple of laughs but nothing to write home about,negative
it sounds as if he is talking into a can why cant he say the name,negative
this is so incredibly bad poor actors that said its so awful that were having a hard time looking away from the screen but not as good,negative
this movie was so horrible they wanted to see what the movie is about now we have to actually put up with this horrible storyline,negative
or maybe two of them have it doesnt really matter ill tell you something thats right i dont know why exactly,negative
this movie is bad not even bad in a so bad its good way more in a so bad its boring way,negative
where when what a waste of a wonderful title not at all the way people talk to each other what was the director thinking the most badly directed scene however is the incredibly over the top battle scene at the beginning of the film while looking at someone off screen she is still young and beautiful and now the same age as her daughter,negative
believe me this movie is just a waste of time,negative
this movie is as bad as bad films get oh and dont forget the sex scene if you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie,negative
it was the only film that he ever directed and the reason is obvious,negative
he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie overall its a dull movie bad plot a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors,negative
well there are quite some good jokes in this movie that is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all and you have this movie she is just too cool she cant be real,negative
this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot,negative
if youre a bad movie fan like i am this is great material,negative
it wouldnt surprise me if this was on every actors black list,negative
bad bad movie ill admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not it waste of good idea avoid if possible,negative
this film story is bad enough which can happen in real life im very can not understand when they show us this bad film i say it was bad because there is some reason how can the story script is so weak the words i love you it doesnt meant anything in this film,negative
this is one of those movies that you watch because its bad,negative
mostly it is poor writing and acting and camera work and editing and well poor everything is that the best they could come up with for a name for his character or maybe that was supposed to be funny,negative
all i will say it is one of the most boring films ive ever seen and the acting is very bad,negative
it didnt matter what the plot was or who was in it if it was an american movie people would want to see it and if it was british people wouldnt want to see it,negative
then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does,negative
i think it was a comedy but a not very funny comedy,negative
i just cant figure how in the hell this could be possible,negative
i looked at the cast how bad could it be pretty bad,negative
i have read all three the first two are excellent,negative
come on i just didnt really care for it and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone,negative
based on what little i have seen of this show i dont think i will ever watch it again why would i want to watch that,negative
i would not recommend watching this move it doesnt after the movie was over i through it behind my t,negative
only two of them had actually seen it before what is this dr,negative
but this is absolutely the worst show on television this one will not last,negative
i saw it with my friends and i couldnt believe what had happened they never made me laugh he was one of my favorite characters in the first two,negative
well in fact its none of this at all now thats what i call worth watching,negative
did i mention that the storyline made no sense theres not much else to say about the movie,negative
and this isnt the first time in the movie this happens and the story is so worst movie ever,negative
i cant think of one thing good about it and dialogue what dialogue nothing good can come of this movie this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time,negative
this movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this here comes mr,negative
can that work is it possible maybe ill be surprised not,negative
i should have known better well not totally anyway thats a laugh lets see the music is dull and hard to hear in parts,negative
so i had to look it up and now see that it is a movie but now since it isnt a documentary it is now a movie with bad acting so either way it is pretty bad i actually didnt make it to the end so i took it a little personal everyone has their own opinion,negative
im actually being serious the use of music was horrible one would think nothing happens there at all nice work guys,negative
they thought they could do it better and they did one of the worst movies ever made do not go and see it you wont laugh,negative
and this is definitely not one so what is this the rest of the characters i awful movie,negative
she has no real character she is not funny not at all,negative
throughout the movie you will see this sounds decent so far right lets together kill all our friends and then kill each other its sad,negative
seriously if this isnt the worst theme ive ever heard i certainly cant remember it no one in hollywood thats for sure,negative
now for the poorly made sequel it is terrible why the dog is the best in this movie as well will children enjoy this movie,negative
i just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasnt anything like it,negative
as well as boring and annoying terrible how many times does that happen in the movies try something new writers shame on you,negative
surprise anything can happen in a dream lets just say good editing does not call attention to itself look at me you can see my editing no,negative
ive seen most if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one modern romance is an interesting take on the subject of love and out of the relationship and back in it again thats the main reason i like this movie anyway its an ok movie,negative
on a good note i felt the little boy actor was really good at the start of the film,negative
but never there is any action just those people talking but it was funny to watch those people trying to act sounds like action but its not,negative
this movie is a joke it is not worth your time,negative
i can go on guess i was wrong why absolutely not see it see something else,negative
watching this movie really surprised me ive seen better acting in high school plays where did they get these people this is possibly one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen please stay away from this movie not even worth a minute of your time,negative
have three years of the tv series on dvd well i was right took the family to see it dont waste your money,negative
if you have read the book then you know that little to none of the important story making scenes were put into the movie,negative
now thats something i can get behind but a movie they dont make,negative
the main actress may try to live up the character but its the best that she could do trying the strange thing is why would i want to watch this movie,negative
this movie really shows its age however this was not the major problem with the movie it just looked cheap overall the film looked low budget and silly,negative
do not waste your time with this movie awful awful awful dont watch this movie,negative
forget about it here ok i take that back that bad,negative
if you are down to earth like me you will be sorry you saw it,negative
it has been a long time since i have been to a movie as lame and boring as this one surprise surprise truly a masterpiece,negative
isnt that just a little weird its not that hard really,negative
this one made no sense to me and this disappointed me a lot,negative
what it needed was a different director thats certain and perhaps a different leading lady i cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either i am writing this as i am still watching it if you enjoy watching movies that miss their mark in a big way then watch this one,negative
it was really really bad it was completely ridiculous and it you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this one,negative
and i did not find it to be either funny or entertaining not even in a weird way,negative
the horrible looking fight scenes are the worst ive ever scene in my life they dont even try to make it look realistic give me a break theres also a scene where he does some similar act while in the water basically every episode has scenes similar to that as for the rest of the episode theres not much else i remember,negative
apart from being incredibly slow which i dont mind as long as the wait is worth it but it just isnt,negative
where to start this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen and what was i supposed to hear exactly nothing else needs to be said if you really want to know what not to do when either writing directing or editing a movie watch this,negative
but does it really matter he did ok and so was the girl,negative
that doesnt mean it has no action but look on the dark side of the picture,negative
although i tried i just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on in case this is what any of you think country life is like its definitely not,negative
just where i wish i was when this movie was on,negative
the first few shows were very good and i was looking forward to a long run,negative
i like to dance im looking for some cheap entertainment,negative
okay maybe its not that bad but it is close or was it problem is they really dont,negative
and after hes killed most of you do not waste your time,negative
it is not terrible but isnt really funny at all a second time,negative
t dr how does she know nothing will stop it exactly definitely not the classic many seem to make out,negative
none of the stories work what we have here are three stories since when,negative
the movie in about a true story but did they really need the love interest,negative
whats wrong with this he could be a good actor but not in this movie and looks it pretty terrible,negative
fine fine at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no the end for that character,negative
some people have problems with the use of the camera i cant see whats wrong with that,negative
and my problem isnt with the real person who did these things he was a great man what figure that out,negative
i could try to say the character development of dr,negative
i loved her i couldnt believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it too bad,negative
i will always be a fan but avoid this one,negative
i would watch it over and over and over but now i dont on the other hand its better than the good son,negative
after all they nearly cut him out of the whole movie,negative
just to start off the movie was horrible it makes me laugh so somehow this movie takes its place as a good comedy to me,negative
man what can i say the opening scene maybe and the rest of the movie was worth it totally crazy stuff it works out well i tell you,negative
this film fails in two theres no music no other characters no other stories thats why it was so hard for me to watch night mother,negative
what horrible writing and acting what you cant make a good movie with a single character,negative
its worth a look for a laugh but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between i would really love to see this movie in its original form it must have been some picture,negative
what in the world was this movie about nothing in this movie made sense of crap the acting was horrible now really though dont waste your time with this,negative
for this review a list of good points and bad points ill start with the bad thats it,negative
evil never looked so bad they meant it on second thought it ends just soon enough,negative
the storyline was a mess the acting forced nor did anyone else for that matter but obviously its not enough,negative
there was not a single moment during the movie where i can say oh at least this thing is good,negative
youre sure not to care whether or not they will this is not to say theres nothing enjoyable in the flick which is what a horror movie is supposed to do dont pay money to see it though,negative
whatever in the end it was her character that was not that great and she really didnt have much to work with what i will say is that this film is worth watching for a few laughs,negative
i could go on but i wont overall it is a terrible waste of time,negative
there is nothing good to say about this movie he deserves better,negative
i really wanted to like this movie but i just couldnt,negative
however there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing ive ever seen,negative
this is one of those moments where i have to recommend the book rather than the movie,negative
in fact what is the point of it i guess we have to wait for the sequel,negative
dont rent or buy it it was fun to watch anyway there are a couple of female roles but they play no serious role in the action or the plot,negative
i did not like the movie but i cannot say that it is a bad movie it is just special i did not like the movie and i also do not like the people who are in it,negative
i simply cant watch terrible weird black and white movies with little to no dialogue,negative
it looked like a fun low budget horror action western that i could get into only a few laughs were to be found this was an extremely stupid movie,negative
stay the hell away from this one once again its not but where to start theres so much to hate the really good movies as well as the really cheesy ones why this could have been so much fun,negative
if youve read the original novel as i did you will probably hate this thing,negative
i know i do a production instead of new york a they would be able to find better looking guys apparently not the end of that song over and over where did these people learn to write songs again bad writing,negative
they just dont seem to have been told about them or something come on its that simple where a t with a t ive seen a t t forget it,negative
how can a game based on a classic movie be just too awful how dumb was that but then again i was a kid when this game was first out what in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making a video game,negative
this could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that running,negative
then again what do i know im only a child,negative
this leads to well nothing youre watching the wrong movie if thats what youre after im political if he doesnt he certainly should,negative
now we have seen a lot of good zombie movies and a lot of bad ones this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life,negative
for one it just looks too cheap you know no stars,negative
the plot is something thats been done over and over again however this one does it the worst avoid it,negative
i wonder more at how a film does than about what it does maybe thats wrong of me does he even have to understand them,negative
what can i say this was one awful movie to watch i mean is this was has happened to gay cinema it was definitely not worth the wait,negative
we should remember that he was not alone in this feeling,negative
what does this movie have nothing makes sense on any other level,negative
sort of way everything is huge stay away from this movie,negative
even the final plot twist rather the only plot twist does not save this film,negative
then i started watching it it didnt look all that bad i watched it right to the end it is really a feel good movie and a bit of a love story really leaves you with a nice feeling well me anyway,negative
period its not how much its how you use it,negative
book is one thing and real life is other and this film lets down both,negative
s s if you havent read the book read it and avoid this movie,negative
you know they have movies where characters do this they do it in other movies so i should do it here otherwise a must miss,negative
we dont have enough of those we needed another one and not just any one the one i really do think about it,negative
whats the point and again the actors who are supposed to act like theyre not acting were obviously acting i just dont see the point it was a miss,negative
just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong he tries way to hard the rest of the movie is just as bad,negative
but at least not as bad as i thought it might be,negative
but im sure most people know this already give me a break,negative
just saw this at the cinema there is nothing new about this film at all,negative
i saw this movie on a show that was showing bad b movies and trying to get you to buy them its not entertaining in any sense of the word this isnt even a horror movie or scary unless you are talking about watching the actors try to act what was the point in making this movie to try and be funny to be able to make a sequel to a movie no one has seen or will ever watch stay away from this movie,negative
did she do it or didnt she how will it end,negative
i guess if you are into the sci fi and horror stuff it might be interesting the acting was okay but not great if you miss this one dont feel youve lost anything,negative
first of all what do we see on the cover of this movie,negative
this is without a doubt the worst film i have ever seen,negative
this is one of the worst films i have seen in a while,negative
this film will go down as another example of a film as most are that could be so much better even though it would never be great,negative
first of all id like to say that i really enjoyed this movie however that said i cant say that it was a good movie i wasnt the only one oh and dont take kids to it,negative
so far so good why yes yes no no i hope this was your first and last,negative
why because this movie had me lost from two minutes in,negative
i s thats it this film features without a doubt the most terrible performances ive ever seen in a feature film but then again its not like they had much of a script to work with,negative
special effects were terrible script was horrible its much better,negative
didnt the writer for this movie see the other three i think the writers decided that their movie was going to be the last and they could do whatever they wanted this movie is totally out of line with the first two i give this a one start simply because imdb,negative
i love this show i watched every episode last year but i loved those girls they brought the fun and that great dog as well,negative
ok this movie had a terrible premise everyone says what about the director what about him he makes a good movie he makes a bad movie,negative
here is a british actress who can do anything i felt this film didnt have that,negative
i didnt like the novel but this movie made it worse,negative
but oh boy how sad this movie is it is a movie in hollywood style about a movie in a movie,negative
shes better than the material shes working with by far,negative
i understand that the budget was low on this film but come on this is really terrible film making the acting is terrible theres nothing original about the film gore fans avoid this one youre not good at it avoid it isnt even worth making fun of,negative
actually when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie the second half was a silly ending doesnt help either,negative
i only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was so let down,negative
by far this has to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life,negative
i had a real problem with this it would work if that was the joke but it is not you get the idea,negative
the dvd didnt even show the time or how long it was this one is much worse makes no sense,negative
the french cinema seems to often be very good at this sort of thing and i love the french cinema it didnt have a much of a plot there were a lot of characters in this film,negative
obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it,negative
i rather enjoyed it either way it wasnt that bad of a movie i liked it i couldnt take them seriously her role was played well it deserves that much,negative
this is more than a review comedy is hard thats it thats the whole joke is truth there has to be more all the others in the cast are either non actors has been actors or b movie stars,negative
the whole movie just seemed to take itself too seriously,negative
two stars is all i can come up with sorry guys,negative
several times during the movie it made attempts at humor it sets you up for the laugh but not in this film not for a second but not this film at least not like this the drama i dont care who you are it isnt worth your time,negative
i was looking forward to this so much being a big fan of the book no i know you by heart you are inside my heart possibly very probably,negative
maybe it gets better i wouldnt know right something is going wrong in dr i wont tell you the ending because i dont know what it is nor do i care it wouldnt surprise me,negative
i found this movie to be okay romance comedy drama i dont know and i dont make films a final word the editing,negative
the problem with the movie is it doesnt know what it wants to be i would have done the same,negative
yes the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child this movie is really more like the island of dr,negative
this movie was terrible the first half hour is much like a i felt absolutely nothing for this guy awful character development dialogue and plot the worst part about this movie is the title,negative
even better ending the effects were horrible and what was so great about the ending it made no sense was,negative
the acting first of all is ridiculous and lets not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible movies are supposed to be entertaining and this let me be the first to say was not entertainment whatever dont waste your time or your money theyre jokes,negative
what kind of high school is this anyway everyone appears to like them in this movie there is not a plot to be found in this flick,negative
everyone gets killed or nearly so i cannot give the plot away,negative
nothing was really scary about the movie and was not even entertaining not even the weird ending could save this piece of crap i kept looking for something really good to happen but nothing oh well,negative
i havent seen the old movie you could probably for it show up on television,negative
and the plot what plot there really isnt any i could see why,negative
ive read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it,negative
that film while not great was quite good it tries very hard to be funny,negative
this movie was kind of interesting so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch,negative
was there a good performance in the whole thing whats going on here,negative
this film is the worst film i have ever seen the story line is weak i couldnt even follow it the attempts at humor are not the editing is horrible dont waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting,negative
one of the worst movies ive ever seen if this film was supposed to be a comedy i didnt quite get the point,negative
do not waste your time i wish i had seen the other use comments first i have to admit i didnt watch the whole thing it was just too horrible i could go on and on the poor actors this would not even be good as a made for tv flick,negative
i would not recommend this to any one unless you get to see it free,negative
this really is the worst film i have ever seen ever period what was the point in that scene,negative
and i mean any kind the cinematography is the most boring part of the movie,negative
i dont think that the story itself is enough my opinion is that you should go and see the original,negative
brilliant it got to the point where i could say something which i felt would make a stupid comment and it would be the next line in the movie as for special effects and the title the movie did take place in the air,negative
one must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously house of the dead fails to be good bad believe it no avoid,negative
well ill start with the good points now for the low points i dont know why the acting was worse than me reading straight from a script thats what is looked like they were doing,negative
i guess they didnt know either dont take your kids to see dont rent the dvd,negative
this was on of the worst movies i have ever seen it is by far the worst comedy i have ever seen,negative
i dont even remember it being shown on tv last year then again maybe not,negative
hard to say and thats saying something he was almost enough to save this film almost,negative
this may sound crazy to even the people who remember this show but movie maybe i remember it very clearly it was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him that is all i remember if not maybe im still crazy,negative
they even kill a woman for her money out of,negative
do something anything the dialogue when it does come is terrible,negative
so how did this movie end up so poor and the dialog,negative
this however is not one of them did i mention the lack of any real plot or character development please stop not this guy,negative
i havent seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time the actors can you call them actors i would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is you would have to see the movie what,negative
i should first have come here to see these reviews,negative
other than that this was one of the worst movies i ever saw nothing ever happened,negative
oh no i didnt have my period cant even remember the black kids name but real life is like that,negative
what happened where was that in the book save us i sure wish i could id it,negative
this movie is by far worse than that this is by far the most fun youll get from this movie,negative
which i think its one of the worst french or non french movies ever made in the history of cinema nothing good in here except the music of the credits only i work that was too good to be true in here just like this one for sure,negative
even more so now in this day and age then watch the movie,negative
well its none of that but not funny the acting dialog and most of the sets were quite bad what a joke,negative
i have read the book a couple of times and this movie doesnt follow exactly as it should,negative
how in the world can i add any more to this let me see now that would have been a great beginning t,negative
most of the acting is bad it is very boring,negative
i saw it on tv and just didnt know what i was watching,negative
the first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half one can see why,negative
above all you must not take this movie seriously at this point youre probably saying what the finally there are the running scenes just dont take it seriously,negative
seriously seriously the same can be said about short films,negative
it was probably the second worst movie i have ever seen,negative
what was his reason for being there it made no sense this was weird,negative
i take it that this is supposed to be a love story about rich guy poor girl did i mention that this is a really really terrible movie,negative
i mean they should of just kill off all of them,negative
but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did why the hell did i just waste my time watching this,negative
i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame,negative
the sets are cheap and cheesy it is a filmed performance and it is not a good performance and it was not filmed very well,negative
its dead on the screen please dont waste your time and to mr you used to make serious films i remember them they were good,negative
but it wasnt i really liked the street scenes though,negative
the story wasnt bad either just not very original but the directing and a lot of the acting was terrible,negative
the real problem with this story is that theres not much story to the story really very little happens its much more of a premise than a story,negative
basically its everything that happens in front of a camera there is just one scene after another like this,negative
i couldnt tell if this was supposed to be that stupid as a joke or if it just came out that way this was just awful,negative
ive never seen him act ive seen him in lots of films but ive never seen him act,negative
the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long,negative
and at this point i will say that these films are not real and how stupid this looks,negative
this must be a joke you can live without watching this one,negative
dr the movie more often looks and feels like a made for tv one this is also due to the lack of some real good gore so far the worst out of the series,negative
because it makes the plot more interesting and you made your way in here now you can make your way out again,negative
but there can be too much of a good thing lots of people die i dont know why i wish it had had a few jokes,negative
how can i say such a thing havent read the book you ask its simple,negative
maybe it was because of this script did they actually have really written one or was it just made up on the way,negative
can you guess why he did that this old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments thats all its like hell,negative
this was a truly awful movie but in a bad way it was the end,negative
it is so bad it isnt even good for being bad,negative
town meets up with old friends etc good acting good story not here,negative
or perhaps mr im not quite certain but i certainly dont care,negative
the first world war was a particularly dark hour in human history,negative
oh i get it those where special effects silly me,negative
it was poorly shot writing is very weak good for stage not film this role was not for him,negative
whats the message here that they like to watch other people having sex the problem is that the rest of the film makes no sense either on the other hand there isnt much dialogue so this isnt a big problem enjoy,negative
he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie i know what a title,negative
the horror the horror all for the love of money what were they thinking stop it were rich the horror the horror its like a bad two hour tv movie,negative
is it a good film no is it a fun film but i got to hand it to this film although,negative
thats probably the most entertaining part of the film and its beyond funny but everything is badly done in this film ok the characters were stupid as well it was very annoying that doesnt mean that its not entertaining this was an old favorite watch with my best friend,negative
this made the movie a turn off from the beginning,negative
crazy director this is pretty weird a bad movie with some good actors in it it did crazy people i give it and a half out of,negative
this is the worst movie that i have ever seen,negative
the show had great episodes this is not one of them its not a terrible episode its just hard to follow up the man that was death in my opinion you should watch this episode but just dont expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season,negative
this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level,negative
its quite easily one of the worst movies ive ever seen this movie is a complete waste of time seen it,negative
if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left,negative
as a matter of fact most of them do this is not how the story goes i should have made my point by now it is good for a laugh,negative
i expected a lot of action it was so boring,negative
not for everyone not for most but maybe fun for some,negative
but thats another review i thought so then and still do actually,negative
this movie is not good this one has nothing this isnt really a horror movie the acting is not very good either and dont get me started on the dialogue as for the surprise ending surprise there isnt one apparently this is the cut version of the film s,negative
this show was pretty bad so why did i watch it,negative
actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them do not waste your time,negative
ive watched it three times and i think ive wasted enough of my life on this the sex gets a point since its almost non stop,negative
and it just felt like i was watching a really long tv show so that lost a few stars for me right there the acting was okay but nothing to write home about in short it wasnt a bad movie but it just didnt do it for me,negative
its quite beautiful who knows hes still a good actor a,negative
i love the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone not a chance i liked sex in the city a lot and was disappointed by this movie so do not waste your money on this movie go see anything but this,negative
in truth there is not much more that needs to be said it is the same with the direction he was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it they do ok,negative
as of this moment though hes just a kid with a camera and it shows,negative
i did not find sex and the city very good when i saw it but next to the women it was simply brilliant the old movie had a real star power,negative
of course theyre bad how could they be any good there is nothing else quite like it,negative
this is not the true story you want the real story thats the real story,negative
there are no jokes in it its in short a waste of time far away,negative
its pretty bad i will admit that or something like it shes playing herself basically its more enjoyable than this,negative
this movie was lame lame lame what a let down a terrible waste of talent and time,negative
was this movie stupid character development well could it have been better sure but it was funny as hell,negative
its a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he did but no though i would call it one of those so bad its good movies,negative
i have never heard so many made up words in my whole life,negative
we both really liked it it was so bad and oh,negative
some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie,negative
then again what do i know im only a child,negative
now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message,negative
there did not seem to be much humor in it we need more family involved series,negative
but how bad is it really half way through the movie i thought to myself nothing is going to happen in this thing it is truly a movie about nothing why who the hell knows,negative
sure enough thats it if they dont put it together and make it work it simply wont so they didnt and it doesnt i dont think they can i just had to take the time to write this review,negative
is it the worst western ever no i wouldnt say that not even close,negative
definitely a high water mark in the so bad its good genre if you enjoy the very worst of the worst this is for you,negative
as for the acting unfortunately this is not one of them,negative
i cant even find one good thing nothing absolutely nothing the rest is crap,negative
this is the worst movie i have seen in years i couldnt watch it to the end there really is not much to say about it horrible acting incredibly bad lines story everything,negative
yet somehow i could not stop watching it nothing has ever made me want two hours of my life back more than this movie,negative
too bad probably i do not recommend this movie it is a full on waste of time,negative
the jokes are good i even a few moments wonder if theyre even using a script theres way too much story for such a stupid movie like i said,negative
lets see annoying was more like it yes it was just a tv show and wasnt at all reality,negative
well first off the good things the stories arent too bad either i but what can you say its free were we watching the same show,negative
this movie was really that bad no character development no sense of time b i please dont go,negative
not one good reason not to see this movie or so i thought once again why what when where,negative
the story idea is excellent its a shame because with better writing editing and direction this could have been a really good thriller,negative
if you havent then youve never seen family guy isnt that funny the series had its moments but now i think its time just take the show off the air and be done with it you know what is funny,negative
its slow the story is too simple to be true what did the writers of this script think lets make them lets make them,negative
i was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much,negative
the premise for this film is a great one how many times did this guy say man,negative
it may be the worst film i have ever seen,negative
lets talk about the special effects first there could be one single reason to watch this one though,negative
say it to stupid young boys then you have a bit time to have fun,negative
he tries to get the bad guys but doesnt do a very good job the last thing she needs is the death of her husband,negative
this movie just did not move me i felt like it was about one hour too long i would not recommend this movie,negative
the problem is that it is not a very good movie the films premise is simple,negative
ill name the problems in a list the acting the plot,negative
its really too bad why joe didnt just write an original i have no idea,negative
first off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies some people want a movie that makes them think through the entire thing to which i say more power to you this movie is stupid and a complete waste of time well i guess you see where this is going bad,negative
perhaps in view of this one should go a little easy on this film,negative
what does he really believe he is funny he really is mr dull boy in person,negative
no attention to camera or shots in mind this movie has one good part its end,negative
you might have even liked it a lot of people seemed to like it too look at the comments oh well whatever,negative
i also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these character actors were,negative
then the movie takes a turn for the worse as it is now it gets a four and thats being nice if not id recommend that you watch something else,negative
not really it may work for you it didnt for me,negative
apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad,negative
i guess the people who made this film will never read this comment that was all,negative
the acting was by far the worst i have every seen his acting was by far the worst i have ever seen he makes bad actors look good ive said enough,negative
look they want us to come with them the end,negative
i just cannot believe how this got made needs her story,negative
but wait theres some hope yet well yes you can probably guess,negative
ive watched it for a long time and i dont like any of the new stuff,negative
and why there is some nice cinematography and good performances from the two main characters,negative
lets be friends what a great idea only its not,negative
but i had so wrong this movie was exactly as every other horror movies its bad actors and boring music we have seen enough of that,negative
its beyond me why people like it for one thing the acting is horrible for another thing its not funny and now hes making movies oh save us all,negative
we should all pay more attention to that little voice same old same old im your friend i want you to have a happy life stay away from this movie,negative
the acting is poor but then again did you expect anything else,negative
this is the sort of movie that usually has something very powerful to say,negative
this is definitely not entertainment and we are still talking about a comedy,negative
make sure you read it this is a no budget movie in which very little happens at least on screen,negative
which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie really dr in particular the ending is a huge let down in this one,negative
worse that she is out of money basically the movie fails at the script level,negative
but how about the movie itself i was right two times out of three wrong,negative
where do i begin i could go on and on,negative
but this particular movie was lame but seeing that it was a low budget movie i can kind of see where that would come in most of the time,negative
others didnt but this one sure did in that case just fast forward to the parts where he is in the film and avoid the others,negative
now this doesnt mean that his movies are good but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre the movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie,negative
this is just one major example how the book and movie are different,negative
what happens it that it is playing on the tv i watch for a few minutes find that i have take all that i can take and then leave the room and yet and she is not alone as if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing yet like i said it may work for some,negative
but in my opinion he should of had a little more class as far as the movie goes it was poor at best,negative
maybe its me they then meet but this one was different,negative
this movie is not very good i dont know why they did this movie,negative
so this is an hour and a half without fun so the same thing i loved about the movie when i was a kid is now the things i dont like about it the evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is but if you are young you will probably love it,negative
you do get used to it when youve seen enough of these its a bit creepy,negative
without looking at the cast list i would not have known that you see the main character as a child,negative
especially when it tries to be funny i only saw two episodes but those alone turned me off case in point,negative
rent this one after you seen everything else my wife like like this film better then i do maybe its not that bad,negative
what a mess we have here the late mr even the gore is boring,negative
the actors dont have much to work with lack of budget is okay if theres a story but the rest never comes just bad,negative
this is the worst film i have seen in as long as i can remember writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it,negative
this is one of the films we watched but apart from that its complete crap poor,negative
it was boring the story was the only good thing t they cant live the role the main actor tom watch the other roles of this actor,negative
at least its not horror in the usual sense thats why i turned it off after the first four hours think about it,negative
the only thing that this film did was waste an hour and a half of my life i do not recommend this movie to anyone ever,negative
this time i was just wrong way too much well dont music music was average not a bad and somewhat beautiful song why it really did,negative
this was by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen there were not even any good fighting or action sequences or something to that effect someone anyone,negative
this really is the worst movie i have ever seen,negative
all i can say is it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film,negative
they used someone else the actual plot of the film was a mess where to begin i have not read the novel upon which this film is based,negative
why the movie told us none of that i thought it was a joke,negative
he is an excellent actor brilliant in everything except this movie oh,negative
with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low well,negative
its hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released the suspense just wasnt there the music was about as bad as it gets,negative
this series is one of the worst shows i have ever seen if a movie is boring i just make up my own story,negative
the plot is simply stupid and shes the best part of this film,negative
there are films that are so bad they are fun to watch give it a miss,negative
there was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie i have seen some bad movies but this one takes it,negative
i never read the book now i dont really want to i still dont really know what point it was supposed to get across but i do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life or something the acting isnt horrible the other characters are too thats about it just avoid this movie period,negative
finally it doesnt work then the film would be a quite good thriller,negative
i couldnt wait to see this movie about half way through the movie i couldnt wait for it to end it was so annoying i think that his writing was just as bad as his direction,negative
im one of the many who find suspense films and true crime films very interesting dont watch this awful film its not a total waste though,negative
please dont family entertainment i dont think so unless you hate your family that is,negative
after seeing this film i did not want my money back i wanted my time back,negative
sure why not no problem brilliant he deserves to die definitely go figure but do they you will have to see the film to find out,negative
this is the worst movie i have ever seen i wasted my time do not watch this movie,negative
in other words dont waste your time with this one,negative
was it supposed to be serious was it supposed to be funny does anyone actually care awful film,negative
do not see mr it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen nothing in the entire movie was funny,negative
i dont completely understand this though so violence is okay you know why it is not right to take the life of another person no matter how bad they are or how much you hate them,negative
if one is making a period movie one must be true to the period,negative
it is just that bad okay that is a good start we never find out because no one in the film comments on this,negative
what the crap was this thing since it might kill me to use the word movie,negative
story writing is what movie making is about everything is perfect except the story is just poor and so everything fails what would you do no just sad,negative
but the truth is the book wasnt all that great either,negative
could they have made it any more obvious and thats the problem the story fails in far more ways than one,negative
this movie is horrible everything in it has been done before there is nothing original from then on you can guess the whole plot but no her friend is bad and turns on her trying to get her job i hate this movie,negative
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the story is just crap but this this was just an awful experience i felt horrible all over after seeing this do not watch,negative
there simply is no plot it turns out that there is nothing to any of it,negative
if not then its very close well this is like one of those except worse it is an awful movie so if you havent read the book dont watch it,negative
this is a great premise for a movie the overall plot is very original interesting and something to think about,negative
anyone who would waste their money to pay to see it is just too sad for words,negative
the acting was so awful that it was almost funny,negative
his early stuff is some of the best in the genre this however does not live up to its excellent name i could not follow this story what happened in this movie the story is terrible,negative
the show fails on the comedy level the most parents make sure your children never and i mean never watch this,negative
i really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that actually i was looking for something that might make me think but i didnt find it here,negative
this whole movie is just so terrible it is a complete mess the acting is quite possibly the very worst out of any b movie ever made,negative
it wasnt too bad at the time but every time i have tried to watch it since i cant get into it like i did that night,negative
youre all the same at the end the good guys have killed the bad guys end,negative
well it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but i feel i must say something i we do not all live in america i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it,negative
although actors are trying their best well sometimes that isnt much special effects are there is nothing left of the original atmosphere,negative
least not in the version we saw it is a nature film after all but not nearly the whole family you may enjoy it or you may not,negative
b movie at best sound effects are pretty good all we have is this,negative
could be the script as well hard for me to say,negative
the actors are so bad it makes me want to take my own life she is so perfect there isnt anyone like that it is so annoying need i say more i think no,negative
i watched in the beginning and lost interest along the way,negative
i never found it for this movie nothing was good from the script to the very bad effects the worst movie i have ever seen,negative
hard to tell i think it was a cop out,negative
but someone will stop at nothing to run her father out of business,negative
i am totally disappointed since this film is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
i cant understand the hate for this movie it is just so much fun the gore effects were decent for the budget the acting was all right and the story was entertaining i liked it,negative
what were these great actors thinking when they got into this but still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into anyway i brought this movie on myself dont watch this dont watch this dont watch this,negative
because this one just isnt all that good or something,negative
this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life well let me tell you something the movie is not even scary in the least bit,negative
then it hit me the editing wasnt much better the acting the main bad guy was ok too but pretty much everyone else was a joke well one or two period,negative
i couldnt believe that a movie like this was even thought of the end just gets worse and is the worse ending i have ever seen,negative
i thought it was so bad i looked it up on imdb to see what others thought of it,negative
i wish i could take back the time i spent watching this but i kept getting let down,negative
why did this guy hate himself and the world man dont waste your time,negative
the acting is bad overall the movie isnt worth seeing,negative
oh god it could be a very interesting film and in fact it is why see this film on dvd or on tv for a documentary watch this at home,negative
james is in every scene he cannot act to save his life,negative
s on another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic b movie but here it is just a bad attempt at film making,negative
i can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong,negative
i know no one who worked on this film and i wish it would have been great,negative
i should have turned off my tv at that moment and of course the name of some characters two wasted hours,negative
the script was so bad a video game had better sound effects than this film dumb film,negative
what was that and what the hell was that that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldnt even get close to but not for horror more for the horrible attempt,negative
and the ending is absolutely silly a truly horrible movie,negative
try to enjoy it if you decided to view it,negative
i would say this is a background movie wrong the screenplay script is pretty awful it almost seems like its a made for tv movie based on the cinematography am i watching a tv show actually she seemed to have the best voice lead actor is average disappointed for sure,negative
the end the love story is a joke and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow,negative
lets face it while this film is bad just for what it was meant to be it has a certain style to it the movie doesnt look cheap really at all by the way did i mention it is a pretty bad picture,negative
ridiculous why did this film have to be made however this is actually a waste of time,negative
run people run this movie is an horror imagine i give it out of,negative
whats to like about this movie and they were excellent and near the end someone thought of a twist just when we thought it was all totally predictable,negative
good gore but little plot it sure seemed that way i tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe even for a horror film some good characters but not many,negative
however this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction dont waste your time you will be sorry,negative
you do not care at all what happens to the characters so how about the blood and gore,negative
it doesnt have any of these this movie is totally boring but although i am a huge fan of his i couldnt stand this movie,negative
what a fantastic movie you dont buy a single word they say and fails once again,negative
but in this movie we needed someone to like whats the point of the film,negative
certainly not horrible but definitely not good well i guess it wasnt that bad five out of ten but it wasnt that good either the music doesnt help,negative
without question this takes the title of the all time no,negative
this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen,negative
what can you say after watching this movie except now its fast and theres not so much thinking and on top of that there should always be something more interesting to do,negative
this however is as the lead hes awful or maybe its the other way around i cant say for sure and i definitely wouldnt watch it again to make sure the effects are not completely horrible but its close i really cant no never mind i recommend this to fans of lee and no one else if youre looking for a quality film well this isnt it thats for sure,negative
i recommend that you not waste your money on this film or you will be sorry,negative
that is what this movie is first there is the plot at the screen which you wont because you cant possibly expect what happens apparently so,negative
it simply does not make sense in fact nothing in the film makes sense the story is so poorly told that i simply could not understand it this film is very bad avoid it,negative
you like beautiful girls what is there bad to say about beautiful girls women so what does it need that would be no just to be sure they wont forget what does that leave yes the action scenes i was giving this movie a chance but it was a waste of time you have better things to do watch believe me,negative
why the acting is incredibly poor but at least he did show up this is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again what about the special effects i expected mr,negative
b b but you need at least these several characters b,negative
i really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didnt work for me,negative
this film was really terrible what the hell was that for the film is worth watching for a laugh or two but if you dont find bad movies funny stay away,negative
it started off fine with good development but got annoying when he couldnt tell his girlfriend what had happened to him,negative
oh god too short b and whats wrong with being friends with your mother the worst part by far was the ending the end how lame is that so many of us would like to see these two get together why cant we see it okay,negative
no its not of course i also know i cant make movies so i dont try i do know how to watch movies though,negative
comedy is supposed to happen in this film horror is supposed to happen in this film the simply truth is this film just came out wrong period even average its just bad at least the film never took itself seriously,negative
the story takes place in the future but everyone else was just not going to get it first off this movie is basically a movie for kids,negative
it was bad really really bad who thought this was a good idea dumb dumb dumb dont watch this movie not even as a joke,negative
i wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie its a big joke good its entertaining you get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film,negative
there is some gore which is actually nothing all that interesting since the movie is so boring and i couldnt wait for it to end,negative
unfortunately very deep stuff as a result the story is a mess,negative
so it starts with a beautiful old house in the country i was extremely disappointed when i watched this a very big let down,negative
as for the plot im sorry in those films more so in the first two than the third but still,negative
im not sure why she wanted to watch it and left the room next thats how long youve got god this is boring two men meet yes no i thought ive seen enough,negative
where to begin and apparently he wants her who wouldnt right,negative
none appear to have a true relationship family or otherwise with another how did they get together again,negative
at least i would know there was something funny coming up and give me something to look forward to i was disappointed in this very low budget film,negative
now that is fast running he really makes the movie a lot better than it was the period characters were much more realistic and they were much better actors see it once then forget it,negative
not bad performances the film does have its moments but it is not one that i would recommend to go out of your way to view,negative
thats all this movie is i dont know at what point you do something about it but there should have been some times when he could have acted oh well another hour and a half of my life,negative
and now god knows why shes in the game again the acting here is really bad,negative
well that is what happens here but theres more wrong with the film than this and so she did but the film isnt,negative
its not funny its not interesting its not well shot you dont care about the characters not one single one of them big big waste of time and talent,negative
the story simply isnt very interesting not horrible but not memorable kind of boring overall,negative
well that is how i felt after watching this film its almost like watching mr,negative
i am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film it really was too long,negative
i mean come on is that the best the script writers could come up with,negative
this easily makes my personal list of the worst movie ive ever seen but im sure thats nothing unique,negative
seriously this film is not so this is a big change how sad is that i actually tried to watch and understand the plot but there really wasnt one,negative
if you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines then you will absolutely love this movie,negative
the acting in this film is mostly very good the writing less so it could have been so much better,negative
i was never quite sure where this thing was going etc she gets taken off he gets her back leaves her again you get the point,negative
nothing is good for him he is not human in some sense so what i dont think so you see them for almost three hours but in the end you are left with nothing i really dont see the point thats it whats so special and unique about it,negative
but for the life of me i cant find him in the film,negative
thats a far as it goes the rest is simply awful,negative
this movie is just boring stupid movies but this movie was so boring that i felt like i had lost one hour and a half,negative
this must be the worst thriller i have seen in a long long time awful film on the whole,negative
this would have to rate as one of the worst films of all time,negative
sorry it was bad i found this very funny back then and still do,negative
the acting is this movie not bad but not great too but okay and watch able,negative
although it isnt bad it doesnt add anything basically this movie is one big joke,negative
far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others,negative
give me a break whatever what the hell i cant even go on with this review,negative
very little happens in this film i cant recommend this to anyone,negative
most of the time it cant tell whether its a serious movie or a comedy but the worst thing about this movie is that its just boring not enough action not enough humor not enough plot not much of anything really,negative
even if the movie wasnt particularly predictable it still wasnt worth seeing i recommend those two but not this one just avoid it,negative
just a couple of minutes later we then see that particular scene,negative
this movie is the worst ever sorry but this was a total waste of good hours,negative
one of the worst ive even seen thats for sure,negative
did they look like that that is the high school that everyone else went to think back to your history class no no,negative
its a sad turn to see what man has come down to,negative
i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad it was a complete waste of my time,negative
this show is only good if you dont know what talent is basically the plot is simple thats it i like her voice thats it,negative
oh you know what i mean havent seen that before,negative
i could make a better film than this so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before,negative
this movie is really bad just like your typical american couple and wait and wait and wait for them to finally do something they try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with it isnt worth it to hear the poorly written lines yes everyone is happy in the end,negative
at least i know i watched enough of it to know i wont be watching it again soon or ever really lame totally lame comedy that was supposed to be comedy its not worth the effort you can find something more interesting to do,negative
someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesnt mean youre acting,negative
no no no one can only wonder what mr out of,negative
since then ive seen it a number of times they believe theyre going to a party the direction is okay too overall this is a movie worth watching if you love low budget horror films with a sense of humor check it out youll probably like it,negative
the problem i think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original,negative
i liked most of the dialogue i liked the cast i thought it was well acted,negative
at the same time is it a put on or not,negative
in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone seriously,negative
well where do i start the acting was awful in the film were any of the characters original very badly written directed and acted,negative
this is the one running joke i enjoyed the films true problem is that it really doesnt know where to go if it really has any direction at all,negative
this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen,negative
a better action movie and with a more dramatic plot but i wont see it again no way there i said it,negative
she certainly looked like the only one who used them she looked absolutely mean please,negative
although he is one of the best actor in the film he gives the worst performance of them all unfortunately that the only good thing i remember about this film,negative
where to begin well start from the top but this is crap they take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting weak rent it and learn from it it deserves it,negative
i had a really hard time making it through this move it seemed they tried to make to much out of this movie at one point it seemed to turn political which i am not a big fan of in movies if you are looking for a slow moving movie with little to no plot then this is the right movie for you,negative
this show is the worst show ever terrible acting terrible script terrible series,negative
you cant go wrong with them my friend cant go wrong or so the old times would have you to believe,negative
well what can i say about this movie what is this world coming to,negative
thats how this movie is and one more point but why him,negative
i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this horror movie i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie so whats left will not recommend this movie,negative
what a bad film to end an otherwise nice career on thats about it my friends what were they thinking when they made this film,negative
interesting almost and it works but not in the way they thought it would type scenes film school level dream sequences sometimes they act as if the nothing that theyre doing is a big deal,negative
what a terrible movie i thought it would never end,negative
what were they thinking does anyone really believe kids are stupid enough to watch this,negative
but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film oh boy terrible also just what we understand about the house,negative
theyre part of the town they dont have to go there,negative
ok lets call it a plot still work to do,negative
ill give it a two because it has a lot of music otherwise it would be a one i didnt like the movie the movie wasnt what i expected much of the rest of the script doesnt even have any jokes well then why did i pay the check and so on,negative
at least i joe where were we lets just hope the movie will be decent at least,negative
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen yes you read that right really weird right that would happen ok kill them off and well go home,negative
there were lot of similar things to mention the less said the better,negative
this is really a very bad movie why first of all the story is bad they cannot even talk as an actor should why did i buy this movie and what must i do with it now,negative
it is hard to tell at some points then at other points it works as a good action movie,negative
someone told me it was funny no way i say,negative
me and my sister have right now watch that movie a girl she means a lot to him the main part after the war,negative
cheesy dialogue cheesy acting the fight scenes may not be great,negative
do not take kids to see this movie dr seriously shame shame shame on what they do,negative
worst of all its not that scary its cheap you ask how bad could it possibly be the acting is just as bad you dont hate them you dont like them just like this movie,negative
a and gets a job making a gay documentary he wouldnt,negative
thats really what should have happened to this highly predictable film surprise,negative
what a great actor to have in such an awful story the story however why shame actually because this could have been a lot better story and movie,negative
did we really need a big screen re make did they ask the fans do you think they would like that this movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had,negative
especially this last bit is ridiculous why would that be what is this not much for a modern sci fi horror,negative
bad idea what is with that anyway i could go on but ive said too much already we can do it if we work together,negative
apparently much thought and effort went into their making i liked them a lot you didnt is this movie actually worth watching now thats just wrong,negative
hes gone get out of there or just kill him already,negative
that makes this movie a waste of time and money,negative
its bad acting certainly their english basically everything is over the top,negative
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i didnt even watch the whole thing,negative
she said she had seen it before its funny and sad it is over dramatic and the songs arent all that great,negative
if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie,negative
still none of this is fun enough to sit through this avoid,negative
i really hate this show i had watched one episode and i knew this show is really terrible of shame that is really i would i have nothing else to about this if i had one that is,negative
if so i cant find them in fact id go so far as to say theres no character at all no one is bad in this movie maybe they did have fun who knows and thats probably not a good idea,negative
except in this case it doesnt in between times they fall in love,negative
of this title lets begin at the beginning a good place to start as always but an ending like that,negative
total waste of time give this one a big miss,negative
if you want to hear youre ok its good to be you if you want a good sci fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one,negative
go watch a far better comedy surprised that this one is still on the air,negative
at the time i didnt know why i thought it was good but now i do,negative
that could have been pretty good it was horrible its not that he did bad its that ive seen him do so much better not really the other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made for tv movie you know what i mean well,negative
but as soon as the movie started i couldnt believe how different it was at first i was like okay so both of her parents are dead but then came the rest of the movie if they wanted to make a movie like they did they should have given it a different title and named the characters different because then i would go out and watch it again and buy it but when i think about it all i can see is the bad you couldnt pay me to go see it again or buy it,negative
what was the point of that for that matter what was the point of anything in this movie it wasnt even really a second rate movie for that matter,negative
some good people in the cast and it all comes out like this,negative
this film was just so bad there is nothing in the film even worth watching,negative
it almost feels like theres a first half of this movie but it never got made,negative
i will admit however that the soundtrack was good who knows,negative
worth watching but not many would come back for a second view,negative
from the beginning of this film it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good at least as far as true quality goes but run at all ever on the other hand the writing wasnt all that terrible and the story was actually okay,negative
the actors are all quite good but wait for the dvd on this film,negative
its bad and not in a so bad that it is good kind of way,negative
anyone who says that japanese films are bad have never watched this film,negative
too bad the actors did ok but ive certainly seen all of them do better,negative
what can be said about this i mean this in a terrible way a terrible way the story is beyond stupid the script is was there a script the kids are annoying not in this case i had to understand,negative
predictable but enjoyable very obvious badly done and extremely slow good acting though right all in all the first one is worth watching but thats it,negative
i hate this movie that is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie i hate this movie,negative
still the truth makes him free what if i were the one it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of with a cool title like that,negative
in my opinion this movie is not good family fun i dont think so,negative
the original was a good movie this may not have been the worst movie ive ever seen but it comes close,negative
this is the worst movie i have ever seen the movie ends and theyre like well some day well have to kill it,negative
this movie should not be shown only because of this,negative
this movie was really bad i mean really really bad never waste your time with this picture,negative
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it wasnt its just not worth watching,negative
what is the movie about and you are either in it or out of it,negative
every single twist and turn is predictable and yes there it is no theres no suspense at all in this thriller this movie had better acting,negative
but for all its worth i do find myself watching it if its on and i have the time dont get me started on that one,negative
oh my god this was so bad this film takes itself far too seriously unless of course they meant to be funny,negative
there are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced there is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others it looks like a cheap production,negative
ill be short and to the point i didnt write one thing that wasnt the truth,negative
oh where the hell should i begin no either youve already heard it or dont want to much like the movie why the hell should i care if they live or die please then theres the dialogue what the hell kind of crap is that ever they sure didnt make it seem like he did and now the acting either its been done before or it just didnt need to be done,negative
i dont think there is a part of me that could recommend this film to anyone,negative
and dont get me started on dr what is with him and his face sad very sad,negative
why make the film at all like a high school production,negative
never ever take a film just for its good looking title,negative
the entire thing is very beautiful to look at but i still cant recommend it,negative
you will see some good documentary style film footage otherwise its difficult to recommend this as a film,negative
the story is bad and crazy at the same time dont miss it,negative
is it funny is it stupid each and every single episode well then youre probably an actor on this show,negative
some good points the start credits the worst part the hes dead but not really,negative
this is slow plot less and boring big waste of time and money not,negative
a mr the movies was nothing like i expected but theres more to a movie than that she surprised me the most,negative
as a short film it may have worked but as a feature film it is as lost as its characters the acting isnt too bad,negative
there were none i dont keep away from this one,negative
ive heard about this movie for many years and finally got a chance to see it it is then when we find out who did it and why,negative
special effects good script terrible no plot sure the actors were fine for what did he stand in this film,negative
however it does not have much of a plot finally i dont enjoy these type of art films anyway there is not as i said much of a plot but then again that must be the point,negative
this movie made me laugh so much the acting as well was bad the script must have been somewhat of a joke,negative
probably the worst movie i have ever seen worst movie i have ever seen dont rent,negative
it was not at all the direction i thought the story would end on,negative
i was looking forward to seeing a good movie this movie was one of the worst movies that i have seen in my life by the time the movie was over i didnt even get the plot,negative
to make things worse she comes to live in the family home while david is at war why,negative
i wanted to love it i really wanted to and the father living was pretty cheesy i highly recommend the book it is amazing because it is right i cant help but wonder did we read the same book shes not in it,negative
i dont know why i keep doing this to myself,negative
since i thought it was pretty awful as well it got me thinking which film was the worst film i had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind and how did it look awful avoid this movie it is truly awful,negative
when i saw that part i lost all hope then when i saw that part oh,negative
the story just goes on and on what the hell happened to you,negative
there is nothing more to say and nothing more to add,negative
its clear hollywood horror is dead the original a plot that will probably put you off going to see this this is not that movie,negative
how did anyone get the money to put this film together,negative
its terrible nothing like the book might be good if you havent read the book though but it disappointed me really now that would be a good movie it was terrible it was absolutely nothing like the book i would never again watch it,negative
i was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the fairly good rating one to miss,negative
dr the actors are just god awful i just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done give me a break,negative
this really looks like its going to be a good low budget effort what a waste of a great idea,negative
i dont know much about film making but good movies have to tell some sort of a story and thats it for him in the movie nothing and of course thats it for him too gone avoid it,negative
rent this film or buy it even you wont be disappointed,negative
this is a horrible film in every way after viewing this you get the feeling youve wasted an hour and a half of your life,negative
i saw this in the credits dont expect much here the worst of the series so far,negative
the various characters each have a problem and the film shows how bad each problem is for them but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves this is simple stuff,negative
funny how that question what is the worst film you have ever seen is,negative
what a waste of time and i wanted to love it,negative
this film wasnt good at all he looked as if he didnt remember his lines in a few scenes i know yes he didnt want anything to do with that it was a bad film what happened to film being entertaining this film was awful,negative
but that was also anything but interesting whats it about the second half do something else but maybe you will see it completely different,negative
but no matter theres no need to see it through to the end the characters are not believable the plot is not believable,negative
the acting is ok but please mr definitely one to avoid,negative
why ill get to that later absolutely no character development usually violence is at least done well,negative
look this film is terrible and well oh you dont want to know,negative
why does she stay with guy i am not sure there are bunch of things about this movie that i am not sure about,negative
where do i start here script terrible but after saying all that he is still the best actor on show here none of them are good direction not bad but not good either,negative
stupid stupid stupid i would have to fire myself god what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie,negative
this film was absolutely crap what was he trying to do,negative
it is the comedy that the film needed more of,negative
in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction,negative
its difficult to make a living out of being an actor sometimes,negative
they made me watch this in school and it was terrible i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it,negative
last night was the first time i saw it since then he must have been ill during the making of this let me be kind and say she has had a long career more based on her looks than acting talent the action scenes were good but come at the end of film,negative
its worse than awful i could go on and on just like this film but i wont,negative
things just happened to get to the next scene for the life of me i cant understand how this got as many good reviews as it did,negative
the film starts well enough i dont know and i dont particularly care,negative
because theres no real plot no character development no funny jokes,negative
we me and my friend still laugh about how bad the movie was mr,negative
was it the directing or the writing give me a break but it still is a horrible movie,negative
the few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development all that happened was another sex scene more than that i didnt wait to see,negative
who are the good guys and bad guys hard to tell this movie is boring and completely stupid,negative
there were a few funny moments there was just way too much time between them,negative
the scene with the father who left home when i was a child has been told and told and told,negative
this is not a personal thing beyond that its not worth the time,negative
if you believe that were all ok man then this movie is for you kids have it all inside them they just need to let it out,negative
this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever i have never seen worse its so bad that being said i love a good bad movie i tell all my friends to see them because they are bad but this but please stop now,negative
but my god this is the worst horror movie ive seen in a long time and ive watched a lot of horror movies just dont watch this mess,negative
the plot seemed to be going in the right direction and the title actors did well with what they had if they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didnt my opinion dont waste your time or money,negative
theres plenty of gore in the film and its a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring,negative
after all what could go wrong with this b movie a lot but no one is going to remember this movie in another two or three years a waste of time,negative
i tried i really did give it a shot id say not at all or something and me for taking a chance on this at least the men look good other than that not much else to see here,negative
this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme,negative
not bad at all actually i think i can say that this isnt even a film at all oh wait i get it its all that they could get their hands on right well then oh i get it well then question two lets just say that yes,negative
seriously the first movie was good but the second is better,negative
this is one of the worst movies ever made i cant believe how bad it was this movie is just bad bad bad bad movie,negative
this is a very bad movie there is maybe one funny joke it is stupid and it is boring stupid all the way to the end,negative
well youll have to see that bit for yourself just not as often as it should,negative
yes this movie is bad more than half of this movie takes place in a car,negative
im not even sure what genre theyre going for here,negative
people run away from it and sometimes towards it for some reason it was fairly boring,negative
lets keep it that way the movie is a real poor copy of the original oh my god also what was that thing about the gay guy you have to really think what the hell was on directors mind,negative
all in all this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while it meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie,negative
this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen i could make a better movie than that with my own camera why,negative
have fun with bad movies avoid this unless you want to laugh at it,negative
this is a truly awful film i mean come on really,negative
often times the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half it is a comedy and i can say i did laugh a few times in the film,negative
everything is said everything is shown straight and the movie had nothing more than that and talk about acting etc no nothing but all and all dont watch this movie you wont get anything there is nothing in the story or direction if you have to watch it watch it for the little girls acting,negative
sorry to say it is still bad still crap after all these years,negative
there is so much wrong with this movie badly this movie could have been worse how i dont know oh and one last thing,negative
in a word god awful who does that and that whole dog thing i mean really who does that i mean come on how old was he playing,negative
but then the theme started to be clear and i felt the same way,negative
it looked like it had a great story and nice special effects boy was i wrong this is just one of those movies you should see when you want to have a great laugh where did all that money go,negative
we get it on and on it went just annoying the story could have taken place in any city around the world,negative
i was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this but it just did not cut it,negative
movie everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments worst movie i ever saw save your time and money it is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies dont they get a copy of the script first if you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on dvd,negative
what does it mean what is meant by this movie the story of their lives is simple and boring,negative
horrible horrible script the thing is theyre better actors than this movie would have you believe the script is awful and the bad direction doesnt help avoid this movie,negative
he wouldnt period actually i dont think you would need him but left in the open why exactly again really i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is seriously thats just crazy,negative
i wanted to like it you might understand that joke if you see the film but the jokes not worth it,negative
well i wasted my money but not all was bad in this movie,negative
yes friends i have a real problem with the look of that last scene especially,negative
the films a waste of time oh well its too bad because you have all the elements for a great b movie,negative
this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen,negative
s s when he is given leave he goes to the very town that the woman lives in we learn that he doesnt have a family back home theres only one problem she already has a serious relationship with a man that shes in love with she wants to be at home have kids and be close to her family,negative
this is unfortunately not the case thats pretty much it as far as plot development goes the sequel however doesnt cut it the first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we dont really care about one way or another you could do worse but it certainly doesnt live up to the original,negative
where do i start why did he imagine a killer,negative
best line form this movie this is an awful movie,negative
here he is hard to believe i know but his time is here of evil,negative
sounds a bit like us thats because it is and us,negative
although he was trying something different i and the acting is pretty good throughout it just wasnt strong enough in the end,negative
the acting is terrible from no one i have ever heard of although the actress who plays the female doctor is pretty good looking,negative
its a nice ending but it doesnt make up for whats really a poor film,negative
when movies change the book that much but keep the same name it should be a crime,negative
i understand the jokes quite well they just arent good the show is horrible i understand it and thats another horrible thing about it its not funny not funny,negative
there is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters,negative
there were a couple of brilliant scenes end of that story,negative
but when the movie start all cool idea lost themselves and you get a cheesy movie very cheesy,negative
it came across like a made for tv drama not in my experience,negative
its more like the guy you saw in such and such movie like him being in love actually i think he was very funny in that one out of,negative
i too had to fast forward through most of this movie,negative
hes just no good dr you should just get out of film seriously,negative
acting oh no dont ever watch this movie if you really want to live dont watch it there are very good horror movies,negative
will hollywood ever learn ok so he turns out to be a real cop and how about the big twist,negative
its a drama what do i have left the women have each their own way of living even if they are all single,negative
the death scenes are so badly done they are hilarious no thought seems to have been put into the plot,negative
it does not have anything particularly novel or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather dull,negative
this film just doesnt work no two ways about it and thats really pretty much it,negative
some of the acting is good as long as we except that it is only drama,negative
the story the acting the effects the women the action scenes the,negative
i watched it all the way through its something you have to see for yourself,negative
why are you yes i am which is far worse,negative
supposed to be a comedy and i must admit i did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending crap i said it crap,negative
the story of the movie really isnt that bad in fact its somewhat original but the movie form is really as bad as a lot of people say,negative
this is by far the worst of the three stupid,negative
there are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is does anyone think they didnt want to see it work,negative
right etc why sit through this and all will become clear please,negative
why because i have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is yes you heard me right its so bad i cant even find the words,negative
however i had three problems with this film the third problem is that i didnt understand the ending but apparently some people do,negative
but people its definitely the worst movie i had ever seen and i had seen a lot of worst movies believe me,negative
oh what a bad bad very bad movie no living lines either,negative
it was a waste of time to watch it are there really people out there that find it funny and like it i liked that part,negative
well i watched this last night and the one thing that didnt make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward however the movie was just poorly written the death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all just dont waste your time watching this,negative
lets start with the men what else is there then,negative
thats right then it hit me an hour ago where was i oh yes the plot bit i dont get it well never all in all i thought it was a wasted experience,negative
the film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess,negative
is there some reason this film was made that seems to be the whole movie and the first part has nothing to do with the second for example it makes no sense,negative
yes it is a low budget horror flick that is it to a t,negative
keep the action clear get the best music money can buy dont waste your time,negative
dont you just hate it when that happens shes finally free and alone in the house her chance to go for help so what does she do so what does she do come on four times what,negative
in the movie that part was just left out its as if the script writer didnt even read the whole book and just put the parts that he read in the movie,negative
in the beginning and throughout the movie it was great,negative
i usually enjoy films like this its shot documentary style but the acting and writing are just awful well in a way i guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers directors actors etc,negative
and on and on again its not that there is a real fight that you would expect from a movie more like a cheap video game then she shows up at the city,negative
this is her story sort of the film is boring surprise,negative
we dont really get to know any of them please dont rent this,negative
so far so good but more on that later how did she get there,negative
at least thats the best i can figure so they leave and go to the party from there the movie goes,negative
this film im sorry to say was terrible absolutely terrible,negative
my oh my this may be the worst film ive ever seen ever i wanted to like it most of the time,negative
why and as far as my cinema experience goes the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse,negative
nothing dramatic really happens and not a moment too soon,negative
if you have read the novel you will like that better than the movie,negative
the sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack at least for this sort of film,negative
among the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting,negative
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life the plot and message are horrible hes already dead this is overall the worst movie worst movie ever,negative
i just could not the novel you will love her,negative
it was one of three features that were shown that day,negative
i really didnt like this film it was boring and didnt interest me that much at all im more of an action girl and it had none i just really didnt like the movie dont get this movie this just isnt for me,negative
seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real,negative
this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is so much at the house that goes wrong that would not happen it isnt even funny did i laugh during this movie no not even once no horrible horrible horrible,negative
what is this movie supposed to be what a waste what was the thinking there,negative
i have never seen a movie so bad its so bad i dont even want to talk about it and thats the whole point of this isnt it please,negative
the film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are and who the characters are but that is it,negative
there is plenty of drama but not enough to feel good about,negative
and just because someone out there isnt doesnt make it less so back to the film and if youre a director dont make them otherwise some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this movie happen in real life,negative
this movie was terrible you couldnt fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie to start the acting was terrible,negative
wouldnt it be great to know what was his story but we are meant to believe she is possible finally a short note on the acting here that may surprise some of you,negative
lets start with the cover of the dvd first at all at all looking back me and my friend should have known something was up now on to the actual movie its just that stupid,negative
okay im sorry to the cast and crew for this review but this movie is by far the worst ive seen yet first off the acting was okay it could of been better especially in some parts but it was okay the violence was pretty good the blood effects were pretty good but the blood was like that of kill bill b its sad,negative
but as bad as the movie was truly i have watched this movie many times it always makes me feel good even still i like it a lot so there it is good fun right,negative
so whats the point of this review you may ask,negative
it is as simple as that where to start bad acting bad jokes you have seen the title picture it is not at least not much good,negative
this is quite possibly the worst documentary i have ever seen,negative
i thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs well it turns out that this movie really was terrible,negative
you just cant miss this film comes on it is so brilliant so original it is so great enjoy,negative
the film has very little dialog and what there is doesnt tell you much,negative
i think that you can not imagine how these people really work that really is no easy work i dont think that the material given to them can really show that as i think this material isnt very good but they are truly good,negative
while the film is by no means horrible it doesnt make sense at all,negative
my god i dont think so no it was played straight,negative
oh man you get the picture were talking really bad directing,negative
the plot of this movie was ridiculous then come to find out all the events were just a dream,negative
i saw this film when it came out and thats that,negative
so i said it and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story,negative
such as the war at home most of the time anyway you know who you are,negative
that is until i watched some episodes oh boy its really bad tv nothing,negative
hes the only one well enough said plot what plot enjoy,negative
however where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script,negative
one of the worst movies ive ever seen completely ridiculous the story is bad seriously,negative
but the pay off is just not there this is a comedy right,negative
i ask you is the ending of this film believable i think not,negative
the cast was quite good and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously,negative
its a quality movie with good direction and great acting,negative
after just a few minutes it really became annoying for me,negative
the script was also poor oh man i hate it when movies try to do that it was awful i thought he was great sounds like a cool story,negative
the acting isnt great from no one i have ever heard of,negative
this is not first of all let me start off with the acting none of it is really that good but that isnt saying much thats about it well i guess it only looks good in the dark but that isnt a good thing you know what im talking about finally i ask i cant figure out where this went wrong,negative
that was a bad start and the movie went down from there,negative
but this film it is something else i cant say it is the worst movie ever because i couldnt make it through the entire film but it is certainly close,negative
however the good ending doesnt save the whole picture which i probably wouldnt watch again it just isnt that funny,negative
youre in no way as cool as you think you are how about you do something that is actually funny,negative
youve seen it done before and youve seen it done better even the video game was better about ten minutes before the ending,negative
but the reality in this movie is far from that there was absolutely nothing in this that i found interesting at all,negative
what was that for i mean what was the point at best it would have gone straight to video and at worst would never have been made in the first place,negative
here she has even lost her talent as a star and then this,negative
a movie this dumb should never see the light of day i no one has never seen him not even the hit men themselves i,negative
the opening sequence had a terrible rock song and better than sex the only other cool part of the movie this isnt a so bad its good movie its just bad however this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it,negative
i saw this movie on and decided to give it a try the main question i have about this film is well that is all i have to say about this movie,negative
i didnt hate this one there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score it gave the film a lot of atmosphere thats about all i liked in it though i didnt really like it,negative
she says yes no good but you like him then,negative
nothing about the film seemed real to me i am very disappointed and think i wasted an hour and a half of my life,negative
was one written but unfortunately they cant save this film,negative
i dont think its terrible but its not really good either the cast is pretty good in what theyre given but again you are only as good as the script so if you want to see a film that you wont get much from but wont really hate either well this is for you,negative
i was never sure if it was meant to be scary or funny all in all a strange film that you will either hate or love,negative
maybe im alone here but this is a crap show,negative
this is one of them but thats about all this movie has going for it,negative
dont see this movie bad acting and stupid gore effects a complete waste of time go figure,negative
it was obvious they were just killing time she was just there,negative
it is too good to be bad but too bad to be any good,negative
french movies like these are just waste of time why watch this movie even i did not know why what what is the use of it then did i learn something from this movie youve got to see this movie,negative
every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as its opening avoid this film,negative
but oh my god dont get me wrong i love this guy thats all but maybe thats the fun of it all he just took the money and that was it again this whole movie is totally weird,negative
a in a word dont waste your time with this one my wife and i wish we didnt,negative
gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and thats saying a lot,negative
he is not famous so self important and hes got it,negative
but i do find that women get my films better,negative
the acting is awful overall a very poorly done movie,negative
brilliant acting excellent plot wonderful special effects no no oh thats right,negative
i cant actually think of one good point in this film the story is absolutely terrible i have seen a lot of films and i have to say that this is the worst film i have ever seen,negative
as you might imagine this film is not very realistic,negative
so i did watch it both for themselves are pretty good but together,negative
who is it and why i was looking forward to it but boy it did not work at all but it doesnt work with a better script this could have become a great horror film,negative
how can a movie with such a great cast go so wrong,negative
i dont know this is a really bad but funny in the way that really bad movies can be,negative
the plot is just cant believe this film got made,negative
this picture was the worst just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear,negative
this was really the worst movie ive ever seen anyone who has seen it will know what im talking about please everyone dont waste your time,negative
but not in this case they spent some money and it shows,negative
but we knew this movie didnt have bad actors thats the humor you can expect,negative
do you know why i say that i have never written a review for one before what did i expect its a tv movie they usually arent good as is this one well maybe not the second its over but within a few minutes,negative
there was not a single memorable character in the whole film how does that happen this film has nothing to recommend it,negative
but i had no idea how bad why but thats not all for those who like to make fun of dumb stuff youll love it,negative
the movie is pretty full of such stupid things i can not recommend it at all,negative
i really wanted to like this movie so what else could go wrong,negative
ill leave you to guess which one it was to be actually i cant understand why anyone would take this script on except a first time director looking for the experience nice direction but thats not why i watch movies,negative
there is no way out in my opinion the idea is brilliant it could have been very scary indeed i really like the beginning of the movie this is his first attempt i am not going to rate this film out of though,negative
i have seen a lot of movies in my life but not many as bad as this is this a movie that you would like to see i guess not dont waste your money on this movie,negative
very realistic or something to that effect yes very realistic too bad the acting and script arent,negative
and not only that goes well under the mark what were you thinking taking this one on,negative
the worst movie ive ever seen and ive seen lots of crap please be serious and i do not want to talk about the quality of the actors,negative
dont believe it why who knows nothing makes any sense there is no action there is no sex there is no comedy and you know what,negative
i cant believe how bad this film is unfortunately thats as interesting as it gets or so i guess,negative
so was it worth the wait and it goes on from there was it worth the wait the ending doesnt save the film either oh my god my eyes my eyes,negative
i can imagine everyone thinking my god this is horrible not funny totally lame,negative
the dialog is very good then something goes wrong and if the others were real did he kill them too,negative
and one only in my opinion she is a wonderful actress on stage as well as on the screen,negative
with friends like these the front cover looked quite scary thought id watch it,negative
this is the way he was the film seems to say big deal,negative
guess what right great writing in killing her off they killed the movie,negative
but i found the acting terrible it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life,negative
i really had a hard time just getting through this film,negative
this tv made thriller is all talk little action by the end i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning,negative
awful acting check bad script check just stay away from this one,negative
what should this tell me what kind of plays does he write he does not why because his wife is dont ask me maybe i should give the book a chance,negative
if you know nothing about michael you wont understand a thing it is much better but the only thing is it will cover up to bad era,negative
and you had big money so what went wrong still with me so far if you got that final question wrong you were out of the game got it okay,negative
we know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters,negative
this has to be the worst movie ive seen this year im sorry for my bad english,negative
there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this film his sister could have done a better job,negative
they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it i feel very sad kids cant see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie and the end its an open ending why,negative
another awful movie from hollywood i wonder what kind of people who like this movie,negative
even for those who might enjoy horror movies this movie could be too much,negative
i was also disappointed with this movie please let us know isnt it time to take a little break from all that,negative
this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series,negative
of course word did not get out yet about how bad the movie was,negative
what else is left to say ive read all the reviews here and most are right on evil open your eyes please,negative
you were right cant say you re wrong for me this movie was too stupid,negative
it just goes on like that nothing makes sense in this story,negative
i tried to love this movie i really did okay three or four of those type scenes but i did sit and watch most of them,negative
on the face of it this film looked like it might be really good it isnt dont waste your time,negative
right away this film was ridiculous its too bad each of the actors can act but this film was lame,negative
there are two funny parts in the whole movie the jokes are very old this is not a film that most people could really get into but some did so ill be nice,negative
what can i say it doesnt stand out above other movies but it always keeps your attention i know this movie has a high rating but it doesnt add up,negative
and while i havent seen all of their other movies ive always enjoyed their performances until now,negative
we had so looked forward to it but had my kids not been there my husband and i would have left,negative
it doesnt appear so and for what nothing really happens in this film but nothing comes of it,negative
what a waste of a cast do not even rent it just ok i felt sorry for him the actor in case people remember this mess,negative
when the book ends mr dark in the movie mr,negative
no man has yet taken a gun away from me said the american then why arent there more of you when what happens between now and may you going to be here to keep order part of the time what about the rest of the time and he does others get shot,negative
the rest of the film is not its just not true,negative
just once please on a personal note i really wanted this to work,negative
the directors cut version which was the one i saw was very long for this type of movie almost two hours is way too long as a horror movie it doesnt work,negative
this movie doesnt follow the storyline in the book i think he was in the first book i also like how mr the book told a great story this movie could have told a great story read the book its a better use of your time,negative
you are seen as not getting it of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway it doesnt make sense it isnt supposed to but i know it was to be a tv series at first all things he would not have filmed for television that was a great film this is not,negative
i actually liked certain things about this game the music was fine,negative
one of the worst movies ive ever seen unfortunately this was too much just horrible and funny,negative
i couldnt stand to watch all of it it was so predictable that it was funny,negative
unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie for them,negative
i just wish they had taken it in another direction,negative
thats not how life works thats not how people are this show doesnt take place in this reality i cant even watch his older movies without thinking of this show,negative
what a horrible horrible film not that i saw much real horror this one,negative
and whats with that look she gives everyone perhaps its part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine,negative
well it could be but when you hear of a big production you expect to see something new something different oh there is a political side too to tell the truth i dont know,negative
i wish my old man was like that this is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget,negative
this movie was extremely boring the animation isnt very good in this the humor in this is not very good i didnt think any of it was funny,negative
mind you its not supposed to be but it is all i remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater and that i didnt really like it very much sounds good right try and see for yourself but anyway a classic for all time,negative
why even make a film like this that obviously isnt going to be any good,negative
if you dont want to take my word for it just watch it and youll see what i mean although the plot is not even as good they took so many lines from the first movie its hard to tell which movie youre watching,negative
it was an excellent version and very much like the book,negative
a quality horror film for the fans that already know what to expect,negative
she gets out the car she gets in the car she gets out the car she gets in the car,negative
awful do nothing else he looks ridiculous watch the film youll see what i mean some of the voice acting is pretty good,negative
he is love dont take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie,negative
here it is a dead man well sometimes that happens but not like this it is as if the writer were the famous mr,negative
this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ever,negative
i had years before as a child and didnt like it then either,negative
and as it turned out this isnt exactly where the plot went there are a few good things i liked about the film my favorite part of the film but didnt,negative
all i have to say is save your time and money almost,negative
this movie does not rock as others have said i found it really boring and silly the first part of this film is not a horror film at all but rather an after school special so back to the horror part of the film what what fun is that in a horror movie why you ask,negative
this is almost certainly the worst western ive ever seen,negative
okay that is the movie the only thing i liked in the woman had a nice body,negative
more like the hot rock instead and even that was good for a few laughs,negative
this movie is awful please save yourself and dont watch this movie,negative
for what some of the action is good to ok,negative
i wish some really good parts come along for her she really deserves it,negative
it just goes on and on the movie really has nothing to recommend it,negative
i was highly disappointed in this movie that is all even if i didnt read the book it was too sad,negative
this doesnt really make sense and doesnt work also the acting is weak i never felt like i was into the movie yet i felt like i was watching people act,negative
the movie is just that a low budget b movie flick and its supposed to be around for a long time,negative
never watch this movie i wanted to break the dvd it will just make you hate him,negative
this is an awful film oh and he is rich and there is no reason given as to why she does she just does it is not a pretty picture,negative
obviously he did this crap for the pay check if youre going to call a movie a comedy then it should be funny this wasnt,negative
this movie was so stupid no nothing and you had to have known that she wanted this right from the start how on earth did they last that long,negative
but wait it only gets worse youll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is,negative
but it just simply isnt very funny all of this should have been a laugh a minute,negative
here goes there was no or little tv none for kids there was school even the girls got into it this movie was the entertainment but quickly came to be kids movies why would i do that well it is a terrible movie no matter how i love it should people watch it of course i am not saying to stay away the plot is simple you can love a bad movie,negative
this movie was so predictable dont waste your time people,negative
this was one of the worst movies ever how predictable,negative
right if you want a laugh then you really need to watch this film,negative
none of it really worked out i dont think so,negative
as for the stories themselves well that is until he starts to act weird and there you have it,negative
when you get your hands on a british film you expect some sort of quality that alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours why they made this film,negative
okay now what the hell is this supposed to be yes that must be it do you know what it is or dont you,negative
sound interesting well it isnt but then again what plot i can only wonder if that,negative
isnt it maybe sorry to say i dont really care,negative
this is one of the worst films ive seen first off theres no plot and the way the people die is so stupid definitely the worst film ive seen in years,negative
probably one of the worst movies ever made im still trying to figure if it was meant to be fun but for sure i had no fun at all,negative
i felt very let down watching this film one of the worst british films that i have ever watched if only the movie had more of a storyline this would have bad an excellent movie,negative
i dont remember the original movie so i cant say if its better or worse,negative
then boy if all people were that stupid i wouldnt even be writing this review,negative
please save your money and go see something else this movie was such piece of crap not a single laugh it was that horrible,negative
what a boring film can someone say boring however overall the cinematography came up short other than that this movie was a piece of crap,negative
all in all i thought it was okay but could have been really good,negative
on the plus side i didnt think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the tv,negative
im not really sure why someone would make a movie like this it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies but only had the time and money to make one what was that other show that wasnt as good seriously,negative
its bad very bad the movie is not quite as predictable as you would think and thats not a good thing avoid it,negative
guys what can i tell you nothing more to see here waste of film,negative
i have to say this is one of the worst films ive ever seen,negative
never see this movie it is very lame save yourself its too late for me but just dont watch it,negative
theres nothing in his eyes at all its like he just doesnt care about anything throughout the whole film and this is the leading man,negative
i wanted to see this just to see how it was done its pretty bad and will turn you off reading them was she the directors daughter one thing they did right very well done maybe they would enjoy it,negative
this movie never knew what it wanted to be nothing ever works here,negative
i knew it got a lot of bad reviews this isnt her worst movie though yet,negative
i basically couldnt wait for this thing to get over,negative
i certainly dont think this movie is bad just because hes the director,negative
but in whole its a b movie acting is mostly ok ive seen worse of this too cool,negative
i didnt think the french could make a bad movie but i was clearly very wrong,negative
and you read this review all the way to the end seriously no stars not a one now id pay to see that,negative
whats the story here what is this of course a real killer i,negative
all these elements just did not really help this movie along,negative
seeing it again all these years later i can see why still this movie is pretty bad,negative
it isnt so deep a some characters are more entertaining than others,negative
is absolutely hilarious see thats funny i mean this is supposed to be a comedy,negative
however seeing so many actual good horror films this was one of the worst,negative
oh my god what was that terrible dont waste your time,negative
i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie,negative
what they dont know is dr or something a twist an hour in was pretty good and the five young actors are actually good some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well acted and interesting unfortunately the dialogue wasnt really there for them,negative
does anyone care do they think we care do they care if we care probably not,negative
after writing my review of her film there i wanted to see more of her found this movie it was pretty bad bad directing i hope to find her other movies,negative
i dont really know where to start here this is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and that is saying a lot because i have seen some bad ones first the acting then there is the action,negative
oh well i thought it should be a good action but it was not the plot is clear from the beginning if you want good action dont rent this movie,negative
a plus for a nice dvd cover though and a great looking female actor,negative
as many of the other reviews on this show say because i hate this show just as much as they do,negative
it was that bad it turns out she was serious i told her not to waste her time what is that about nothing about this makes any sense that alone should tell just how bad this is,negative
this script makes good actors look bad the only scene i liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all who does that,negative
thats it really what is the point in all this,negative
i rather enjoy that british woman but theres nothing to this show,negative
to make things worse theres not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film,negative
as if someone would say mr right like this film wait that happened,negative
what is wrong everything what did i like about this movie,negative
this film was terrible i thought it would be ok but it just got worse and worse a complete waste of time,negative
i cant believe i actually spent almost three hours of my life watching this at the screen what were they thinking when they made this movie,negative
i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie and it didnt work once this movie in my opinion was the worst movie ever made ever,negative
the ending has to be the most the script had to have hit someone as being totally ridiculous no one in the group could say anything good about the film except that it was over,negative
i should love this movie the movie makes working class people look low and cheap i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it again the acting was very very good and worth watching i really dont like the story line,negative
the acting was good but that cannot save lack of story,negative
i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews what a waste of time,negative
but youll see what i mean if you see it,negative
i almost expected his to say at one point were in a bad situation mr the special effects dont help either well lame,negative
a bad movie about a bad movie is that original or what if it is then thats the only good thing about it,negative
so far so good so why did i watch the whole thing they may not be great actors but they are real people two points for the sometimes decent special effects,negative
its just bad its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film,negative
ive heard that mr this is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot i need to go do something anything dont see this movie,negative
he was quite clearly the best character in the movie make me believe that the story is true,negative
i dont think this film is worth any more space probably not even this much,negative
this film has no heart how many cheap shots can a film take,negative
a real shame seriously she was it makes no sense i know the real problem with this is the script theres just no getting around that its bad its really really bad the whole thing comes across as a great big waste,negative
mystery boy was i wrong the scary kind believe in god or you will go to hell is the message here but actually it ends up worse avoid,negative
this movie is just bad bad bad bad this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is lame other than that all bad the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i cant ever get back,negative
what can i say i enjoy the guy check check check now to the acting you make your opinion script or direction,negative
to those who loved it im sorry this is my opinion,negative
some movies you watch and you say well that made no sense and you dont really mean it and i mean it theres no script theres no plot theres no story of any kind so what they want to show you gore they give you gore why even talk about it but the movie doesnt do anything with them too bad if there had been a story of any kind at all it would have made for a much more entertaining film the film is very much like the beautiful car you would love to own,negative
all other things are really annoying the other actors are also not very good but the worst point of all is the story it is absolutely ridiculous this is just one example for the stupid story but it would take too long to tell them all,negative
i truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste,negative
i was expecting a b movie french musical and the songs what songs,negative
i wouldnt exactly call this a good movie in fact it might even be a bad one even if only on the big screen,negative
even though the movie had its down points i still saw it and thought it was okay,negative
have i seen a worse movie nothing i havent seen on the tv series she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film thats telling you how horrible this movie is,negative
who thought that it would ever come to this really it really is bad,negative
they can kill the acting is no better than the horrible dialog and the attempts at humor are not funny,negative
first of all i can make a much better movie than this one the special effects made this film look like a joke the acting and direction was also horrible the songs were also bad need i say more thats why i watched it i am going into film and i wanted to see how bad a bad film can get,negative
so sorry i really tried to like it didnt learn too much about any of the characters so it didnt matter if we lost one or two along the way this isnt the worst movie in the world,negative
sorry this movie is just a cheap tv production no atmosphere very boring more then worse fight scenes some good ideas not more i hope i will get the chance to make a movie like this and then i show how to do such a movie sorry for my bad english,negative
this was bad just dont see it wait i take that back hes actually pretty good but other than that bad,negative
do i want to see the romance with his wife no well thats what you get with this film the acting is good for such a low budget piece of crap it at least has style,negative
it was pretty bad whatever you dont need to waste your time watching it its that bad,negative
let us not forget how weak the characters become its sad i know,negative
that means that there is a good chance that youll enjoy it more than i did it does we dont get to learn anything about any of them that may be true but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way thats a fine thing to make a film about that would certainly be enough for one film however there are many more ideas here a girl comes along what to do another example that was enough for its own film too just dont expect too much from things to come,negative
is there a genre such as horror for children in that case this film is definitely it,negative
does that make it a work of art im not sure about you guys but i dont,negative
i was happy the dialog throughout the film was just horrible,negative
the script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script,negative
i think this is almost all i need to say however the reason for that is even a let down shame its such a low point,negative
the lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows he was more annoying then anything,negative
this movie is about nothing just as the characters in the film stand for nothing its crap this isnt art,negative
this is just another one of those he gave it his all every time he was in front of the camera,negative
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is yes its that bad nothing at all to recommend,negative
just there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own however i think there is some other problems here why,negative
the is no development in character they just seem to say and do things that i could never believe a real person would dont watch this film,negative
this made for tv movie is just god awful although it does use as far as i can tell almost the same dialog it just doesnt work is it the acting the poor directing ok so its made for tv but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original,negative
no then she said she doesnt love her mother so she dont love both father and mother,negative
what was that supposed to mean and another annoying thing whats up with these directors,negative
and it did but no go but again no go and what does this movie tell us evil evil men,negative
i have not seen and heard the original version i hope the original is better the rest is a simple thriller not really good ideas,negative
the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going different story for a different time,negative
give me my money back give me my life back okay i understand the premise and the idea sound but give us a break get a life sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time my money and my being why obvious but why how much did this movie make enough said,negative
this is one god awful flick the last point that i have is,negative
thats fine its just that every story premise well you wouldnt know it from watching this one,negative
it is not good its not a bad movie either,negative
i cant stand the character at all even the theme song is bad the title even worse,negative
im never much for classic films basically this movie is boring,negative
well what to write but its definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it but i guess you cant have everything,negative
the movie is poorly filmed i thought the acting was terrible they were not believable and they didnt give me any reason for me to care about them the war scenes were very short and only last a couple of minutes,negative
its really really really really really really really really really really bad he had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking if you watch that version youll laugh yourself silly im huge,negative
he is old looking then this is the movie to see,negative
the dog can act hes a dog and this movie is a dog,negative
the movie isnt too bad up until for the time it was made its a beautiful movie and does get a lot of it right however,negative
you believe in god or you dont you believe he is the son of god or you dont,negative
for me its a case youll never understand if you didnt live it my father loved him and it was dumb move youll know why this hero whom ive watched and what a huge and ive got the original and no less,negative
but i doubt many were running to see this movie or some came running out of the cinema,negative
why do films like this get made in the first place,negative
that its hard to imagine that well see a worse movie this year or in the following years,negative
you ask how could you even get as far as the credits and then watch them,negative
i cant believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories ive ever wasted my time on dont waste your time here,negative
bad to the point where it is funny i mean come on even the cover is bad ok the special effects are absolutely ridiculous but the worst thing is the screenplay and the so called story incredibly hard if you look at this and they do lots of it this movie is incredibly dull and this goes on and on and on and the story,negative
he was awful just awful and its not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible but take it from me theyre bad,negative
please if you have anything else to do with your time dont go to see this movie and even if you dont have anything else to do stay home and watch tv,negative
i had problems with the plot and who the main character was thats not good either,negative
more power to him but i wish he wouldnt subject us to his home movies,negative
my favorite type this film is among the worst however it has little to say,negative
but its a decent movie to see once i guess,negative
i am here to tell you that they were wrong completely wrong in that case it worked,negative
ever good good good now look interested good now look beautiful again good never mind what history says,negative
i just dont get these reviews it just wasnt funny,negative
you can tell that from the dvd box apart from this im not really sure what was going on not sure if i hear the later episodes are better maybe ill look for them,negative
i never saw something like that to the acting the young female is terrible i recommend that you dont even think to see this movie,negative
this is the movie that i think of days later,negative
this was not a good movie why do you people keep saying that why where did they come from also what the hell quickly too end of story do not rent buy or even watch this movie at a friends house you will wish you had that time of your life back,negative
the acting is horrible possibly from the bad director the plot was stupid the movie is stupid all the way through making it one of the worst i have ever seen,negative
not a good one not at all its basically nothing because this ones just ridiculous,negative
but i mostly enjoyed it sort of kind of actually worth watching,negative
i enjoy action movies but he is the worst actor i have ever seen i didnt care for it at all give this film a miss,negative
and if you see anything else by him forget it i wont say anything about the plot others have already enough already its crap dont waste your time on it,negative
this was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies ive seen in a very long time not thinking at all is my guess,negative
there are so many problems i dont know where to start so ill talk about what is good about the film the cast was great there is no real plot i wouldnt see this movie again for free,negative
performance of actors is weak sets are fine could have been better the story is also weak battle sequences are awful i dont get it,negative
having finally seen the movie now i can see how they did it i think that is a huge shame overall the movie i thought was really bad about the only good thing about it was the soundtrack it is obvious now why this was,negative
i had never heard of this film until it came to dvd i havent read the novel but im going to guess it was a lot better than the film,negative
she he s just there it couldnt be any worse,negative
i did not like the characters in this film either this film has a bad message and even worse acting and characters so you do not have to see this one and that is a good thing because i do not recommend this film at all,negative
and of course like most movies and t this movie was boring,negative
so why did i hate the rest of the film so much but this is exactly what happens in this film so what do they do is anyone that stupid,negative
one of the movies i just didnt want to see at the end of the movie i still am surprised i watched the whole movie,negative
this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production ever how the acting was terrible and then took the people who were turned away,negative
the second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes he could take care of himself right,negative
the plot sound cool does it see i cannot believe i took so long to write about such a horrible film and i think well stop there real real hard,negative
now i know why they put it straight to video,negative
you just want the dark side to get every one of them,negative
this is a low budget movie and it shows another complete waste of time and money so dont see it,negative
overall i felt bad for the actors as i watched this movie but the writing was not the worst part of this movie,negative
add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film,negative
especially the writing without good writing a movie doesnt have a chance believe me it was no big surprise,negative
bad acting her acting was the best in the whole film,negative
i thought that this film might be funny because the guy with the huge head there was so much sex that i hate women and men now see the movie party,negative
okay anyone looking to see a great work of art should not watch this film mr i know mr this wasnt a bad thing it was almost as if they said okay mr while not great it is still pretty cool to see,negative
its easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors that would be an excellent time,negative
i dont understand the people here the characters are not believable the film doesnt look good but what do you expect the film was shot for very little money on video,negative
this movie was nothing like the book this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book,negative
and some how they make this even worse than you could imagine,negative
the acting wasnt bad but it wasnt that good either it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by and what wasnt predictable was done so badly that it didnt matter the ending was not worth watching at all maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one,negative
why not i could go on but ive lost interest,negative
dr when dr the use of time to move the story along can really get annoying,negative
why why do i always fall for it this was a bad movie just stay away,negative
i just saw the movie in theater the movie has very few good points to talk about thats it but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real they cant make it,negative
where do they really stand with each other she says as if it was big of her what a shame it couldnt have been something better,negative
it is a movie that could have been much better than it was not oscar material true but much better than it was why were we there what exactly is the point of the opening sequence i thought the movie wasnt that badly acted and once this movie hit the production room things just got worse the main actress i think had the same problems,negative
then i saw it again okay i mean we see it all the time a lot but it works,negative
its the least i can do this is a bad movie are all second rate let it go,negative
as for the movie nothing special your three hours would be better spent reading or re reading the book,negative
instead mr he does this over and over and over again without any real development,negative
whats even worse though is the editing of this film,negative
that is all that is needed for me to love the movie i watched it like i watch any other movie and was disappointed it isnt about the making of the movie that is true the writing and directing were very weak i know i think i should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason,negative
so whats the plot of this film its hard to say to what point,negative
maybe due to being a group effort dumb fun great screen writing,negative
yes its another zombie movie not so much fun oh why must the pretty ones be so dumb that cant be right oh and a fun note,negative
there was nothing on the movie that was good the only thing that i can get from the movie is that he was a good son but a low life terrible person i got worse,negative
i cant really say the acting is bad nor is the directing the music is decent what blood thats there is decent and the cast looks quite good,negative
an idea thats been done to death what would happen if,negative
this movie is almost too bad for words when watching this film for the first time it felt like id seen it before why was this,negative
i just dont get it im not going to even mention mr this is a movie you watch for laughs theres nothing else to it,negative
apart from that theres really nothing more i can add,negative
unfortunately nothing else in this film is any better this is one of those times wait for the red eye video and dont watch it then either,negative
if such movies are the future of horror then i seriously give up,negative
at least the ending is worth the wait for those who will still care by that time,negative
he killed two people and the movie couldnt even get that right a joke and nothing more ok i would like to add on to this how do i know all of this please,negative
however i can say that i wish i had seen this other movie instead of the one i saw and then some first the acting second the direction ill give one example see the scene for yourself its almost funny almost third the script it is instead just boring could it,negative
but it was still an ok horror film with some good action i did not think that it was one of the best in the series,negative
throughout the movie were supposed to guess whos the killer or does she,negative
however it doesnt i have to go kill someone he left and that was the end of it what was that,negative
let me be clear ive used imdb for years i get it but it doesnt happen at all until far into the film,negative
it isnt that great of a scene because it really doesnt show anything i was for the two girls the whole time,negative
the effects in this movie are horrible and cheap i cant recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends,negative
just dont go see this one see something else dont waste your time here,negative
dont get me wrong i wasnt expecting much to begin with did we just waste our time watching,negative
this film is on my list of worst movies ever made the movie is that bad,negative
theyre terrible when you see them really why did they do this where that they hard up for money that alone should tell you something a must miss,negative
im not just saying that because im used to better movies,negative
now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good but other than that avoid it,negative
is it possible to give a movie no stars fine we can work around that we get the worst looking stuff used again and again thats what directors are for if he was i can say he doesnt know how to do it,negative
this movie had a good story but was brought down because it didnt have enough horror film elements and violence,negative
it was really the lead character the daughter whose performance was bad,negative
what a let down the last episode was dull dull dull five hours of my life for that,negative
i think not this isnt even a dark comedy all the good guys were killed so long ago that they had no time to look good i gave this movie a two only because the soundtrack was good but not even that was all that memorable,negative
obviously it seems many people really enjoyed this movie and thats wonderful unfortunately the film has a lot of problems and it was not something i enjoyed watching it is just not very funny,negative
the cinematography is very moving as is the music unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story john than the character from the novel i have no idea what they were thinking,negative
lets see how much worse can the horror genre get i have seen many great low budget films,negative
or rather i had nothing else to watch oh well,negative
its just an awful movie but thats about all want to know more,negative
this is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else its not bad as such but badly made and dull,negative
now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie,negative
how i would have loved to see him in the role,negative
it was without a doubt the worst movie that ive seen in a long time,negative
but then again you would probably get the same effect from watching the film something anything sorry,negative
it should have never been made if you want to know how not to make a movie watch this film to learn a thing or two if not dont waste your time thats too stupid even for me,negative
original movie i have ever seen this is one to avoid,negative
what is a movie how to tell a story you are expecting to be told a story and it doesnt happen i was expecting a lot more from this short thats all theres nothing else theres no plot,negative
the rest of the cast however was excellent only what the play called for to very good effect,negative
its been a while since seeing this the first time so i watched it again with the second movie in the series what can you expect from a low budget b movie i didnt have a problem with the acting but not the left behind series,negative
suspense in a supposed comedy movie so definitely some people enjoyed this movie,negative
by that time you wont really care though it wasnt a fun bad movie though my least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer otherwise dont waste your time or money on this,negative
wrong the storyline was not good it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story the characters were weak especially the daughter no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again,negative
and i really did my best to enjoy the movie but i just couldnt the jokes arent funny enough and most of the times i like and understand the humor used in those movies the characters that are portrayed in this movie know that this isnt a serious movie and show that all is about the fun everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never fall out of character and because of this certain scenes become funny and hilarious they dont do things with a straight face the jokes would have worked better if they did so what is left to be enjoyed and there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple but i do wonder if children actually would like this movie waste of time,negative
scary stuff the result i kid you not as i said avoid it except for a good laugh,negative
i dont know what would be so great about this movie first of all there is no story but in my opinion this movie does not do that either,negative
this character just didnt feel the same and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie,negative
i loved this movie ill admit it this has to be the best straight to video movie ive seen well we knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected plus more and why it is worth the money and its not even that bad like its bad but not incredibly bad,negative
something told me to go see meet the parents instead,negative
the only good thing in this movie is the acting the three female leads are better than most horror films like this,negative
s it was low budget but that isnt the problem the problem is the movie is just lame it doesnt really make a lot of sense there was just no reason for it all but so what,negative
ok here i go anyway ok directing of this film was not pretty bad i see so how can we say it is an art movie just funny,negative
but what a bad surprise some movies really do not age in style but what about movies which didnt have any sense of style at all,negative
the director has really kept it real and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life i had to watch other films by this director for a class the others were not as boring,negative
i could care less who was on the screen in this film,negative
awful awful awful no i didnt like it it didnt come across as a work of art and yet it wasnt a documentary either,negative
that much is obvious the director needed to make her a hero and never does,negative
but i had no idea what i was getting myself into i finally know what hell is like its this movie it didnt even really have a plot dont even watch it not even to see how bad it is,negative
he what can this film be as terrible as he says,negative
give me a break i hope that you never have to sit through this movie dont watch this seriously,negative
i knew it the audience knew it and the cast knew it,negative
the actors are terrible the whole thing is filmed at night because they say that is the only time you ever see it they film at night to make it scary one of the most boring movies ive ever seen this is really bad,negative
its hard to comment on this movie i didnt care for one moment about any of them also it was very predictable whats good i was looking forward to it but i did not get what was expected,negative
im big into acting writing and directing but not famous yet this is the beginning of the movie worst movie ever,negative
dont watch for the love of god dont watch but save yourself,negative
what have we seen the first wrong sequence of events for then,negative
believe me i like horror movies and i like low budget b movies to bad they didnt try that instead i just dont understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot was it the characters was it the dialog the music,negative
and i dont think many other people liked it as well as me boring boring boring,negative
maybe its me maybe i dont get the premise of the film why do i do it apart from that its not to bad,negative
what were these people thinking i could not enjoy a movie such as this,negative
ill start with what i liked but thats about it,negative
the acting was over the top the script was just a joke and this one does,negative
i dont remember seeing another murder mystery movie as bad as this,negative
this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
seriously sci fi needs to stop making movies theyre all horrible dr but they cant stop it they cant stop it either stay away from this movie,negative
oh man and i really liked it then he got pretty old pretty fast nothing happened at all,negative
but lets start from the top who am i to say they arent oh right however this short little story is done with style and he gets it wrong every time now that does take some kind of talent right its okay nothing more waste it on better movies,negative
the director didnt do his job another director would have done a better job,negative
its one of the most boring movies i have seen in my life the only part i liked is the ending but its so slow that not even the fantastic ending can save this movie,negative
i dont know but the movie was just too similar to other movies ive seen,negative
most definitely i have seen few films look this good in some time who can stop them and save the world the plot for this film is ridiculous,negative
i was so disappointed in this movie his love life,negative
this movie was horrible the only reason i didnt was because i simply didnt think to do it one scene comes to mind nothing dont go see it dont buy the dvd when it comes out either,negative
unfortunately no one would figure this out after watching the film,negative
but there didnt seem to be a story to go along with the great idea waste of good characters which were the best thing about this film,negative
not just to me but to everyone else who was forced to sit through this awful film im very sorry,negative
next on the list is the acting this movie just wasnt scary thats all but then were would the story be,negative
and then it all went to hell the writing for most part is terrible miss this one,negative
this film doesnt add anything new to its genre mr she and mr,negative
is it the acting or the script that is bad or both,negative
that being said this film is absolutely crazy and in my opinion not crazy in a good way,negative
the plot isnt even the worst part of this movie there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie,negative
that is indeed the real horror that is dr it has very little going for it,negative
in fact im not even sure what happened at the end any more,negative
i was expecting more action and more comedy there are very few if any light moments,negative
however no matter how much i love their films i just cant recommend this film i cant think of the right word creepy is all that comes to mind what a creepy little film,negative
i first off the ending by the end i seriously didnt care sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldnt get into it are you serious,negative
no simply put it isnt there maybe we were but the thing is for me to like both films and movies they have to be original i just wish someone other than me would understand this,negative
i love it it didnt i doubt it the jokes are awful,negative
the worst was yet to come it was good it was pretty poor they were quite well done it was very good she was probably the best bit of the show,negative
sometimes it worked other times it did not acting was okay script was okay,negative
i thought this movie was going to be good i think not,negative
this movie was so bad it was funny i still cant believe how this thing got made,negative
what am i saying it isnt i think that is what happened do you even care is it funny since mr do you think mr i just dont see it it is the worst film ever because hes supposed to be a good director etc,negative
usually its so bad that you can laugh at it,negative
okay maybe not the last part but thats basically what youve got here and as a movie for kids forget it,negative
the other actors were ok nothing horrible well everything that makes it good,negative
well guess what i thought it was a good idea at the time but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the film although maybe it was too serious no right,negative
really really horrible in every sense s this movie is nothing more,negative
i like black humor but this was way too dark for me,negative
i really tried to like this movie second the plot is just non sense how could she believe him scenes like those you will find plenty avoid this movie,negative
i heard about this film and knew it wasnt real good,negative
but i cant all of the above would have been great but there was none of that,negative
does it all really lead back to family i wasnt so sure id give it a five,negative
i will not say much about this film because there is not much to say because there is not much there to talk about,negative
i knew it was going to be awful but not this awful all the characters are dull and the story is stupid and incredibly boring plus the ending is especially lame the direction is horrible the acting is terrible,negative
but i feel she was given her head rather too much oh give it a rest,negative
bad camera work and what is it maybe maybe not dumb dumb dumb,negative
unfortunately as the film turned out she doesnt have the character from the book to play,negative
boy was i wrong so theres a movie i can use as an example,negative
where do you even begin i cant think of even one character who was portrayed well the story was god awful but this film is up there with the worst ive seen dont watch it just dont none,negative
god where do i begin come on people i cannot begin to cover everything that was wrong about this movie there is just too much to cover,negative
the kids are terrible how can someone so bad be the main actor of a movie,negative
what has she done to herself what a terrible idea,negative
this show is awful no comedy no plot no good characters with the same director so thats okay but keep this show gone and never bring it back never ever ever ever i really wish this show was funny sorry but my opinion stupid very stupid my opinion again,negative
there really isnt a lot to say just give it a miss,negative
but this is not a good movie im sorry it just isnt it has too many characters,negative
we are never told why these people believe this i could go on but i do not want to make this as boring as the film,negative
and the fact that they made this writer put it off for a bit seriously ok so how many lines to i have to type i dont get this at all is this enough finally,negative
this comedy is really not funny more than that its hard to say and who wants that,negative
there really isnt much of a story and there is no character development,negative
the actors the incredibly lame make up and special effects the music the script in general all dialogue was forced and terrible the editing what were you thinking at least i didnt pay to watch it,negative
this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the cast was fantastic but the movie itself was horrible i watched this movie and i wanted to break it every minute i watched it could have been great had a great premise you couldnt pay me to watch this movie ever again dont ever watch it,negative
this movie was boring the lead couple were boring and there was so little character development that i didnt care about any character in the film i wouldnt recommend this movie i didnt find it fun or interesting,negative
i could go on and on about how awful it is but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living,negative
and they all have been in much better movies the actors give it their all but they couldnt go too far with such a lame script the world will never know,negative
but every other one is there yet within minutes it became clear how bad this was going to be avoid,negative
what does he do no do the girls stop no why do we hear this sound anything again who knows bad man if this script wasnt written by a child id be surprised what were you thinking,negative
after finally getting the chance to see it last night im sorry to say that i was incredibly disappointed no wait it makes it look like a great film,negative
this movie has the worst acting writing directing special effects you name it its the worst ever anyway there is not much else in this movie that is worth watching an hour and a half of my life i want back right now,negative
i came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better here is where the main problem with the movie begins,negative
she is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure,negative
oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre,negative
where was the plot where was the acting who came up with the idea to make this why why i guess well never know,negative
it takes talent to take something as bad as the movie and make it worse,negative
there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film i did not care all that much she meets a guy mr if only the real world was anything close to this,negative
the one joke comic situation is supposed to be watching an old man doing funny things that are really done by a young black man,negative
this was just an awful movie do not watch this movie,negative
there is the plot etc etc unfortunately a waste of time,negative
unfortunately no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same,negative
dont get me wrong though this was not a good movie in any way at times its funny but more often than not its just very annoying and predictable,negative
i love the first three love movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be i think the script writers should have went more by the book,negative
there is some good action here and there but not much,negative
not much of that in the movie if the supporting cast were meant to be funny they certainly didnt do a good job,negative
they could have come up with some better name i have never seen anything of the like but but special effects acting not really you wish wait,negative
but horror my friends it is not come now and at any rate the movie isnt scary not once not at all,negative
one of the worst films i have ever seen worst special effect this is truly a horrible horrible film,negative
it was just like one of their movies only someone high would laugh at these jokes,negative
there i said it you want more well too bad the first time was actually somewhat creepy,negative
this is my first comment on a movie in here dont even look at it it is boring bad acting bad script and plot bad effects the whole movie is one big piece of crap but i would say the movie is worse than awful there didnt came any good scene at all what an excellent piece of crap,negative
was it the acting directing script in this movie it was hard to tell who the bad guy was,negative
i give it one star out of five for the battle scenes,negative
or better still why not just make them look good in the first place sure you could say but the movie is a joke get it sure im with that idea but do it well and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way what was he doing there no forget it,negative
he was right i may have to see another of this particular directors films as he seems to have a certain following,negative
of course the husband doesnt believe any of this etc,negative
from what i understand mr end of story is it supposed to be scary not in the least is it supposed to be funny and i really dont like to have to say that,negative
and again i say the original movie had a lot to say and didnt go out of its way to say it,negative
there is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off why did they do in a living room the movie was that bad,negative
the acting was pretty good as far as gore theres not much going on if youve seen one youve seen them all two movies that arent just great horror movies but great movies in general,negative
so how to enjoy this movie on video a fast forward through all the dialogue b,negative
on the other hand seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun or funny,negative
romance others here say the book is great well be it the screenplay direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie,negative
this was perhaps the worst movie ive seen in a long long time,negative
i enjoy a good slow moving drama no point no entertainment and guess what its actually interesting,negative
kids like these could have been a decent film given the subject matter,negative
ok fans its out on dvd all come to mind theres lots better out there,negative
i looked forward to the day when i could have it in,negative
this sequel should never have been done the first did it all and better,negative
all i have ever seen were few older movies of s oh my how wrong i was,negative
the ending is predictable and has been done to death,negative
i would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book,negative
well not really is not new avoid this film that totally does not follow,negative
it was a film to be taken seriously there is absolutely nothing scary about it,negative
yes bad things do and did happen but in general the people there are just like you and me,negative
this movie has been done before however the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way,negative
i wish i had read the comments on imdb before i saw this movie the screenplay is horrible,negative
in this movie the performance of some of the actors is horrible and the script is nothing special,negative
everything was terrible from the start the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all,negative
acting not quite as bad as the writing but still bad this movie did not stop,negative
hard to say really so what the hell is this,negative
the problem is of course that often you dont know which of the three a film will be going in,negative
at any rate this is a terrible movie in them i hope she becomes big and make this thing at least worth something dont watch this total waste of time,negative
this is one of the worst written movies ive ever had to sit through cut back to character close up,negative
all in all this movie is a waste of time and money and effort,negative
more sex cant go wrong there well i want more violence and sex shame on the actors in this film but what i want to know is,negative
this movie was based on actual fact did i miss something here,negative
unfortunately nothing else happens absolutely nothing then again im sure i was reading much too much into the film then again what do i know im only a child,negative
what happened when will something happen save your money save your time,negative
with a cast list like this one i expected far better it was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none,negative
were supposed to like him because hes nice but thats about all he is,negative
my ten year old liked it for me it was hard to get through it,negative
why was this movie ever made i was only able to watch half of it and i didnt laugh once at least i didnt pay to see it because it was on t if you like terrible movies then this youre movie,negative
ive seen a lot of bad movies in my life that was bad but this this is just its not good its as simple as that oh and its not funny its awful so awful he cant write a comedy or a horror movie im serious i didnt laugh once throughout this whole movie what was the budget for this movie i mean what the hell,negative
i really cant say anything bad or good about this thing pretty much a waste of time,negative
another stupid movie sound too music is middle good question but they are not good actress,negative
it is not even a comedy its more like a really really really bad documentary,negative
i thought wonderful this will be great i was so wrong in fact i still dont get it and have sex where was the story rent it if you really want to,negative
i did not laugh one time during the entire movie,negative
his acting was also really really bad this was not a completely terrible movie most of the acting was ok and the lead actress was very good the final fight scene did get me sort of interested even though i knew everything that was going to happen long before it did i could go on and on but only because there was nothing else to watch while i worked out you could do worse especially if you are looking for a movie with strong female characters but you could also do much much better,negative
the script is bad the plot is bad the acting is bad but the director got nothing out of them if the plot sounds bad its worse on the little screen,negative
if they are why not make it more obvious what gives,negative
no no no no and it got worse so much worse how many times have i seen this movie for shame,negative
this is his worst film he has ever been in the acting and the story was just terrible,negative
i am not easily lost with movies but i had no idea who was on whos side,negative
not him of course just everything he does fantastic this could be great,negative
maybe but showing in this film we are not that stupid and it doesnt work that way lets see what the film is trying to do fine the film is really long and slow and guess what the beautiful country which one,negative
horrible acting by decent actors it could have been so good,negative
the couple from the first movie played a small role in this movie,negative
okay so im thinking cool this should be real good no you are no you go i think we should go home well i dont theres way better stuff than this,negative
then this what can you make of it so where are we so sorry,negative
oh wait im working total crap who lets this stuff be released,negative
as to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion,negative
okay now that you know these things you know the whole movie so dont waste your money when will they learn,negative
whats wrong with this film many many things exactly and did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film at all,negative
i loved the book and i knew it couldnt be as bad as people said,negative
so it has come to this really wait theres more how can we do that what they want it back kill them kill yourself and your wife,negative
s die hard fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it,negative
this is the worst kind of film shame on them,negative
one of the women is killed this is a serious problem,negative
the music well it isnt a great help to the film,negative
this has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen,negative
the plot is not original if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before,negative
but it still doesnt save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting really dull if not stay well clear,negative
everyone knows the story which wasnt that bad for a kids movie yes it is a kids movie his attempts to act crazy are not very good and overall acting is poor everyone else is not too bad at least i was able to sit through this,negative
this movie is a masterpiece this movie is a masterpiece this film is a masterpiece this film is a masterpiece this is not a good thing this film is a masterpiece this film is a masterpiece,negative
but what is it and why is it here this has all the right elements for a classic the problem here is the monster,negative
the single worst film ive ever seen in a theater first of all if youre going to do a musical find someone with musical talent not in this case some of the acting was pretty good but a lot of the dialog was terrible as well as most of the scenes,negative
together again and if you didnt like him there why are you reading this review no stars,negative
hard truth are you serious the actors were terrible do boys everyone,negative
the dialogue particularly the romantic dialogue is terrible it did acting was also off we know okay guess that says it all,negative
this in turn makes the movie rather more boring why she is not just his wife who knows as this part of the plot really goes no where,negative
direction must be the problem here i cant imagine anyone even those making money off of this rating it even as much as average,negative
kind of not really though let me tell you something who had not anyway getting back to the plot its funny and what do they do thats a great way to learn the truth people live there i just thought that was funny way to go guys,negative
i cant think of much to say about this film this was an awful movie it wasnt,negative
the story the characters the cinematography the music it all worked theres nothing there,negative
so yes this is a very important film just not a very good one,negative
i would not go to that country no matter what after i saw this movie,negative
who what where when why the acting was terrible i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles,negative
i just want to talk to you i want to get to know you i guess blood type is not important,negative
this sequel is the same as before with an all out action sequence opening the film,negative
this is a very bad movie the acting is terrible the dialogue is terrible the special effects are terrible the plot is predictable stay away,negative
first this movie was not that bad it was entertaining stupid,negative
where are they going that is until the end this was good until the end no how original how dull,negative
what that was it did i just write that did i just see that,negative
when i say worse i mean less entertaining mr if you want to see what a bad movie is check this out,negative
these people take themselves way too seriously another person says that there is no such thing as love the movies title is true hands down the worst movie ive ever seen,negative
the horror of this made for tv film was that it didnt end with this one this had none of that,negative
the animation was average at most then we have character development or lack there of what as for the story i like a bit of sci fi,negative
where do i start maybe they only had one camera this movie is poorly made and poorly done hollywood is dead i like the big screen have since i was a kid this movie is a dog dont waste your time or money on it,negative
true to the title theres not much there to begin with its nothing original and not very special so dont go in for the story at all just look at the effects,negative
here it is was it took three people to write this story,negative
what happened here i tried hard to like it and im usually very easy to please but im really disappointed,negative
what the hell we didnt get it at all that movie was terrible this is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie bad suspense movie,negative
really when it comes down to it this movie is just not funny,negative
the other comments give the idea well enough really you need to rent it and see for yourself,negative
and boy was i wrong and that is pretty scary,negative
i would have liked to see a movie about her,negative
this comes close to the worst movie ive ever seen the only good thing about this movie that i saw was the cast,negative
so what i am writing this for i cant imagine,negative
it should have said the should never be seen ending,negative
i like bad movies were all quite good at it in fact,negative
towards the end i lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue the little boy was very good,negative
she still looks hot though it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film,negative
or are they that badly out of money the main problem with the movie is that its boring,negative
it has a good cast it has a fine director i was expecting something dark at least it was to me and that is about it,negative
the rest of the acting is not awful but its not good either,negative
talk about so bad it made me laugh all in all a crap piece of film making,negative
seemed like a made for tv movie and a bad one at that anything,negative
i tried to like this movie but i just didnt care about the characters at all especially the ending that made me hate him even more,negative
this film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it and by the way if you give it some thought and i did you can figure out how the ending could come about i just wish i had back the time that i wasted thinking about it but my point is that there could have been so much more to this film sorry but no,negative
it started off really good with a man running from something,negative
its so not its not that hes bad but hes almost always in bad movies the script is terrible,negative
as a result i really dont know if the original show really was bad it might have been brilliant,negative
the beautiful women were the best part of the movie even then you wont remember a thing from this one two days later,negative
mr i think the viewer let alone mr living off his rich parents you can get away with most anything in a film if the jokes are really funny mr,negative
definitely a b movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved,negative
this movie has lots of action and little heart now back to our story she does a good job with what little she is given to do but that is not much,negative
it would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice,negative
how can this possibly go wrong well unfortunately it can,negative
the plot is a lot like do the right thing,negative
if he gets that one wrong he leaves with nothing there is hope for the world,negative
i seriously wish i could go back in time and stop me most people will tell you that films like house of the dead or s i wrong this will be how i wish i never watched this the acting actually isnt so bad but not this one dont watch this,negative
the movie surprised me quite a bit in my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst for me going to this movie was a waste of my time,negative
this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen the acting was terrible horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone what a waste of time its absolutely ridiculous as for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary,negative
the movie looks fantastic unfortunately it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go unfortunately the rest of the movie is just extremely boring that was well done what youre left with is a movie that has very little worth,negative
this western musical comedy is not one of the best of the genre i have seen i found it much too slow i couldnt wait for it to be over otherwise though i cant think of much to recommend this movie anyway,negative
with a face like that who could ever doubt it in the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter he seems to be extremely happy,negative
you kept looking around you at those watching the film with you going what,negative
the movie was not good at all when looking at the movie alone and not thinking about the book at all it was still a terrible movie ever everything else was totally off why they had to change that i dont understand that didnt happen in the movie why did they leave those times out i could go on and on and on but then i would run out of space just read the book again because its terrible and nothing like the book,negative
there was so much going for this film its a dumb movie,negative
this movie is a total dog the writing in this film is absolutely terrible,negative
when it finally came out i was one of the first ones to rent it,negative
and a world without any funny jokes that was just lame,negative
but here they dont predictable you can just imagine this ending while watching the opening credits,negative
the special effects are good but the movie itself is not,negative
why do people make bad movies didnt anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point,negative
finally it is in fact the story which lets the rest down,negative
people talk they talk and talk two can play that game but why go on see it if you must,negative
i thought this will be a good film no i dont you love me no i dont you love me no i dont then well i dont love you im sorry for the time i lost watching it worst film ever seen,negative
i give this movie a one for it is truly an awful movie,negative
my wife and i saw every episode in this series and loved it a waste of great writing and acting,negative
i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life,negative
but moving a tv show to the big screen isnt easy and this just didnt feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didnt move along that well,negative
the story is very weak and there is little action most of the characters are given little to nothing to do anyway thats just my opinion,negative
it is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character but i guess that is the name of the game in hollywood now there is a great film for you,negative
black comedy there isnt a black person in it and there isnt one funny thing in it either they may have taken out other stuff too who knows all we know is that whatever they took out isnt there any more the acting seemed ok to me its supposed to be a city,negative
unfortunately this is one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time,negative
boy was i wrong etc no none i can think of,negative
this may be the only bad film he ever made,negative
the acting was good but so what acting is good in many films,negative
i was really really disappointed with this movie again like we dont already have enough of them on top of this some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense,negative
i saw this film with my two children one of whom knows the book and the other of whom doesnt im not sure what this means,negative
i think not average id say its predictable original give me a break you people need to get out more,negative
why was it evil what made it that way except that there was no follow up on that oh by the way well except for the tv its all been done before the oh it was all just a dream no it wasnt it just didnt make sense youll be in my place overall a truly horrible movie,negative
the story is still the same and its a fantastic play during the movie i always had the feeling to watch a play another reason was the look of the movie the acting was really good the end part is better and more interesting,negative
everything about it is a mess review over dont watch this film,negative
which i saw after watching the movie i should have read this first before taking the movie,negative
this is a really really bad movie please take my word for it dont watch it ever im serious stop,negative
the strange people living in a town go about their lives,negative
i dont think so i am not at all sure what is going on well maybe i am the only one that dont the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout with great character,negative
what do you do the bad guy they have nothing to talk about oh another thing a t a t everyone in this movie just didnt think,negative
this one too when why doesnt she do very much of it how long is this thing i feel like ive been watching it for over four hours already is this over yet i want my money back,negative
i actually didnt enjoy this movie i just really didnt like it,negative
i dont know is there some music in the movie to no one,negative
a true waste of talent come on guys think about it next time please,negative
the rest of the storyline was really boring i didnt watch the whole movie,negative
half the time you are looking for something else to do because the movie is that boring since you already know whats going to happen,negative
oh it really really is its not the film i like the least but it is the very worst film ive ever seen it really is awful its just a mess and worth no ones time watching,negative
what a shame our first movie is so bad it is awful there is no story in this film is it bad or what,negative
well let me see just how close i can get to it i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem if you can get more out of it than me better power to you,negative
so what is it then but still i rest my case,negative
so why did he make so few of them well this one was all wrong i think you can figure where this is going no memorable songs came out of this,negative
but thats as far as they take this premise this could have been a good premise but no,negative
this movie starts out as if it were a comedy,negative
well i watched it never again a really well made piece of s it is a very good looking movie ridiculous it is funny at all with a different script either a really funny one or a dead serious one they might have could have should have had a classic on their hands im not sure this one may be the worst of the lot it isnt just that the ideas in the film arent funny as i said a shame,negative
not too good a movie i loved the story and setting,negative
and apparently this type of movie works how is this possible,negative
maybe it was dr the plot isnt easy to follow,negative
i remember thinking that due to the cast the subject matter and the director i was going to love this movie i was not disappointed with the opening and felt that i was truly going to love this movie while all of this is possible it seemed to me to be way over the top save your money and time and avoid this movie,negative
however this horror movie is not scary at all its actually more of a comedy than anything else the film takes itself way too seriously and the movie is not a lot of fun to watch the acting is a complete joke and most of the cast give awful performances the only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere its a little old but it still kind of works the direction is not very good and the screenplay isnt much better,negative
i have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films so that was not my problem with it the other people in it were not then there was the sound,negative
however however this movie plays like a bad version of all of these,negative
come on when did that happen everyone is free it is bad,negative
its especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes but we just dont pay attention we want to know whats going on and instead they just talk and talk and talk about nothing,negative
this film deserves another bad review it is not bad acting how many of you have done that or know anyone who has done that not,negative
what the hell was the director thinking with this move what he had only one day to film all this in anyway good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time,negative
so i had to buy it your could guess what was going to happen its not a horrible movie,negative
really its nothing much youre a big fan of any of the main stars,negative
so for him and him alone this film is worth a look,negative
the film may look nice but its a long two hours to sit through too long,negative
why did i buy this movie on dvd the movie itself,negative
we think that we are going in one direction but instead we head in another one why hollywood needs to let this series end forget about the past and move forward in the future i think a sequel to whos the man would get them started in the right direction,negative
just think about it will he help her funny that,negative
it is supposed to be serious which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke,negative
not really but it was not an easy film to get into,negative
i know others have said enough about the plot s,negative
the worst part of the movie was the special effects i do recommend you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot,negative
this isnt that bad but it is close simply because it should have been better,negative
however there are several major problems the first is mark strong first of all he doesnt look right for mr,negative
this son of a son of a sequel was terrible to say the least,negative
i didnt know how bad though it has a plot but once again its obviously a kids movie,negative
unfortunately the writing and an actor let the show down,negative
and the worst part is that it could have been good maybe mr,negative
the film is annoying the film is way too long,negative
but i thought this film was really weak the script was not good,negative
there are also some nice shots in the film overall i was really disappointed by this film,negative
i thought this movie was terrible watch this movie if you want to waste some time,negative
it makes what could have been a decent scary horror movie just seem silly,negative
the acting is so bad i need not comment on why absolutely awful,negative
if the close camera wasnt enough the lack of light in the film killed it,negative
and makes movies out of them very horrible ones if you expect cool action forget it if you expect a cool story forget it the actors playing makes the movie in a lot of moments funny but in a no good way i had the chance to see this movie for free,negative
i have seen bad acting in my day but this is no acting,negative
the voice over is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own im sure there are plenty of others to watch dont waste your time on this,negative
how it got made is beyond me the plot was weak the ending so you all take heart,negative
theres not a single good line or character in the whole mess,negative
a horrible horrible horrible film that tells you why people are seeing this film,negative
unfortunately it did not turn out to be a good movie it just didnt make a lot of sense,negative
everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality,negative
i really cant think of anything good to say about this film not a single thing the performances were bad by most of the cast ill just stop now,negative
not that i was really surprised ending was different too i doubt youll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as i do every time i read it,negative
some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie,negative
other than that the rest of the film is just boring to watch youll understand if you see the movie,negative
but i really did try at first so it wasnt all bad well guess what was a much better show by far however they should have called it b keep everything else the same just change his name and the name of the show,negative
i just cant see it any other way how do we know its him,negative
now dont get me wrong thats a good point in and of itself i guess mr very telling either way,negative
wrong her performance wasnt strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film,negative
the directing didnt bring anything new or interesting if you dont this movie is not worth it,negative
this should be one of the worst things ever made but for one thing this show is all about george,negative
indeed i didnt think anything could be worse i was wrong its so bad i couldnt even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama id ever seen,negative
the problems are many and the good points are few,negative
but not at all it isnt even a horror movie very very bad movie,negative
apparently not i dont even know where to start with the editing particularly the sound editing the ending was awful,negative
however after watching it i was extremely disappointed this movie felt as though it would never end dont waste your money on this movie,negative
why do we care why do we care why do we care result why do we care,negative
i cant believe he even made this one is he actually that hard up for money,negative
is blood the number one reason to love this to death,negative
the actors are older but none of them looked particularly good,negative
a there is no real life there is no feeling in it,negative
the only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh,negative
oh well at least hes not boring like most of the rest of the cast,negative
this is not just a bad film its one of the worst films ever its so bad that i found it to be quite enjoyable,negative
the fight scenes make up for this however but then the poor sound effects that go with them bring it back down,negative
whatever the next day i thought that i would give the movie another chance and watch the rest,negative
which is fine but it doesnt make for good action when the plot,negative
as a result dr it really is so bad that its good from the past many of the reviews that ive read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are,negative
at least during its first half she has an important role but its a small one,negative
not funny i did not laugh once and as far as i remember a comedy is supposed to make you laugh not this one there is small hope however,negative
where to begin who was she anyway this film sets up the team fairly well only they dont really do much of anything eventually he just leaves all together really,negative
not even funny there is nothing good about this movie,negative
even though he seemed to be giving it some effort he must have needed the money,negative
another gay film this time its showing the black side but why the lead after all its supposed to be gay this is wrong,negative
these are things the characters would know so we should too finally there was an almost complete lack of character development hes exactly the same at the end of the movie whats the point,negative
he is better known for later character roles than for his early leads and very modern but the character has a good heart this is nothing truly special,negative
the cast certainly portrayed their roles well you can see and hear her for yourself to my surprise it turned out to be the director as far as the ending of the movie goes other than the child,negative
i was surprised by how low the humor was in this film,negative
thats the simple cut down version this is where the dream part starts this is reality again shes ok,negative
next the acting is just average i really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material,negative
i know a few things that are worst a few it had a couple of funny scenes dont waste your money just to laugh a couple of times,negative
its not as some movies that are so bad that you can watch those and enjoy this movie is boring as there is nothing as boring as this movie i hate myself i have seen all please dont watch this film please,negative
i couldnt say that its one of the worst movies ive ever seen but its very dull but its something different right one and a half stars,negative
this is a really really bad movie however its good to laugh at the horrible ideas and special effects most everything is predictable from that point,negative
the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters,negative
the story was in a word bad at best the movie wasnt terrible or anything was it decent not really,negative
you pretty much know whos in on it from the beginning i think many of the actors did an ok job first time i ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted,negative
give me a break if youre looking for an great story line,negative
the first half of your movie is pretty good after all it looks like blood in black and white i think i knew enough then to make you a better movie i know i know enough now to do so,negative
it was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made,negative
where do i begin how about with the special effects bad bad bad bad how about the acting if thats what you can call it how about the plot,negative
i wasnt expecting the movie to be that bad forget the movie and read the book,negative
for parents they usually want their kids to watch something good for them no is it funny no the show is also extremely cheesy,negative
that was it but then again i never expected anything less,negative
i went into this movie not expecting much but i had an open mind the whole thing is stupid seriously the worst thing ive ever seen i wasnt anything it wasnt even so bad it was good its just bad ridiculous actually please do not waste your money on this movie dont even rent this movie,negative
but i got the general idea dont let this happen to you,negative
or what happened then or no budget its just kind of dull and boring and silly anyway ive seen much much worse,negative
they seemed not to know what to do and went back to the title for an idea,negative
or music stars and a plot that has been used for several times dont even ask for gore or violence nothing but thats it why change its most important situation thats it and worst of all it means that a sequel may be on the way please dont watch this movie,negative
until i got on imdb i couldnt believe how not scary and awful this movie was ok first of all the problem the rest stop itself obviously the director of this piece of crap doesnt know the first thing about women so right there second of all he just left i mean his car is gone and actually that makes me think how exactly did that happen third they made no sense at all and had no place even being in the movie oh my god this i mean finally near the end of the movie im like you dumb and you just now see i mean oh look its like why didnt she go through that before the dumb cop shes the killer wonderful but it wasnt oh for the love of god people stay away from this movie,negative
i told a friend that i went to see this film and that i thought it was awful,negative
and nothing else the man cant act in this one sorry although i cant say if i would find the movie funny now but nothing else dont expect oscar material on this one guys,negative
that part was just stupid this film doesnt do that had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film but the good guys are horrible now that im over the acting ill get on to plot come on,negative
the jokes if this is the right word for it you might enjoy this movie being totally wasted perhaps,negative
it even has a good script and ending but it has a one poor part what else could you see from this movie its a good mystery and horror movie but of course if you like it go buy it if you dont there still is not reason to waste your money on this,negative
there is nothing really wrong with any of these i,negative
end of days is one of the worst big budget action movies ive ever seen s how could this happen,negative
bad move one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
anyway that was the best part of this movie experience for me they look stupid would you look at that how could they possibly do that to her or like never mind you figure the movie out pretty quickly you really think so,negative
the musical score wait was there a score well you get the point watch it with friends who want a good laugh its full of them,negative
dont get me wrong the reality however is about as far from that as possible,negative
this one if you have not seen that film do not watch this they probably expected something more they are almost all great,negative
this one is from a guy in love with his own writing,negative
one worst shows on tv its not even funny i gave it a second and third change couldnt even make it through five minutes dont waste the time and every reality show out there every stupid game show period the end all it is,negative
the only good thing is we didnt pay to see it,negative
this leaves the script to comment on which was pretty awful i just watched it to see how bad it could be and i still wanted to see the ending go figure,negative
thats what this movie really takes but for what reason just for the fun of getting away with it well i guess i could,negative
and you get to keep them now dont you feel special sorry but for me it just did not make me feel special this one was for the worst i think he looks but wait so i guess it doesnt matter hes just its more,negative
im sorry to say i was very disappointed i wont take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script i cant recommend this film,negative
masterpiece in this case it didnt work out for me,negative
i have to wonder just what is going on sure how about a different plot,negative
i was really looking forward to seeing this film but after watching it i was really disappointed book was so much better,negative
and rent a good horror movie there really was no need to make this movie really really all the characters act in stupid ways including the police front and back by the by if youre a gore fan youll be disappointed too it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough,negative
this may not be the worst comedy of all time but its close,negative
but perhaps not this film however doesnt seem to think so why was this simple what about the films message here the girl is white hes free wait a minute ill tell you why what is the message,negative
im sorry but this is just awful i have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost dont believe me,negative
i wasnt the only one either the people i went with thought it was boring this was a waste of time,negative
i have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad,negative
this kid doesnt know what is acting and he is the hero of the movie,negative
stay away from this movie the special effects did i say special dont waste your money or your time on this one,negative
the premise was too silly and predictable i didnt make it far into the movie let me see he is black and she is white his acting was superb it was ok but the premise is too silly didnt see the end and an old one at that please not in the real world,negative
acting is bad its so simple is this possible in life,negative
this is one of the worst films ive ever seen i turned it off after a little less than an hour though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes i wish i had,negative
theres enough of old action movies with good action this is just a waste of time,negative
this is the first time im writing a comment on a movie on imdb but i had to write it for this one please dont watch it,negative
this movie should have been released as a short movie instead to much time is spent on the same thing,negative
thats it no one else took part in the battle,negative
i just wanted to say that i was very disappointed after seeing this movie,negative
then it got boring this is the plus side to the movie moments the reason i didnt see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense i love crap horror movies but this was too much,negative
just what is it that makes this film so bad well the acting for a start,negative
just look at the cover i mean who wouldnt watch this before stop,negative
this movie is not that interesting except for the first ten minutes,negative
thats a no no for a genre such as this,negative
before going to this movie the day after it came out i came on imdb to check out the comments a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog it had to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen once and the characters were stupid you god moments movies should never be this predictable it was just bad dont waste your time or money go see a good movie,negative
the movie has a good story line the action is good in some parts but not all of them the movie is good that is all i can say,negative
the effects and soundtrack are nothing special and fairly low budget,negative
but then we would not have had a movie then would we and so much could have been done to make this a much better movie,negative
okay let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone whos read the other comments no someone else got there first the case was boring in other words this was a boring game the home version was even worse right whatever run just run,negative
if youre a fan of horror mystery and suspense why wouldnt you let me tell you,negative
why is this film so bad the other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and funny jokes no body seemed to care about it or even try,negative
i saw this film in the movie theater this movie well it is one of those movies after it is over but for good reason,negative
avoid this movie this movie will make you want to avoid or completely turn against water,negative
great cinematography give me a break check young hot shot check check check give me a break and the script by far,negative
they dont have to do that they made a tv series about the movie this is going to be better great job never i dont like that not the same thing over and over never this series did that i hate her,negative
i just went to see this movie with a friend we came out the movies not feeling very sure if we liked it not yes it was pretty entertaining but the plot i felt like it was used from other movies the script was a bit weak im not sure why every time something bad happens the main character says oh my god every time overall the movie was ok but i felt like its been done already go and see buy all means but dont expect too much,negative
what can i say about this wasted time wasted money not as young as she was shown,negative
we were not disappointed in the least overall i would rate this movie as the worst movie i ever saw that took itself seriously,negative
the plot is simple this is even worse if thats possible or killing someone,negative
i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i was wrong my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film it just gets worse and worse theres just too much and a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked stay away far far away,negative
the acting is terrible but even good actors could not save this the dialog is probably the worst part of this movie do not rent this movie if they gave you the movie for free do not watch it,negative
this is one of those so bad it is good films that you always hear about but never see,negative
the acting is even worse i dont care do you most of the action happens in a five minute sequence after that its over,negative
it was good enough though that ill still probably check out the soundtrack,negative
for the movie itself being based on the book was horrible as well,negative
everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true bit its not like either of those has already been done to death,negative
why is the main character the way she is you wont find out from the script,negative
this may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film ive seen in years the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case,negative
where can i begin i thought it would be bad boy was i wrong this movie was much worse than i expected this was not a theater release it is a dvd release still in my opinion there was no reason at all for this to be made that right away killed any chance this movie had of being good why did i check this movie out then some of you may ask i even had some interest in actually seeing what happened now thats not my only problem with the film,negative
plus he just shows up for no reason i dont know what else to say here just watch it when it comes out on tv in a couple years,negative
watch this film and find out forget it outside of some nice cinematography here and there there is nothing to recommend i didnt even go into how bad this is directed,negative
of course why the child doesnt die at this point is beyond me and disappointed for horror fans i couldnt possibly recommend this film to anyone,negative
it happens quite often it never does they may act one way in one scene but then act a completely different way in another scene,negative
my mother forced me to watch this movie with her,negative
it was obvious from the opening shots this wasnt a real movie not even a b movie different somehow,negative
im a big fan of movies that make you think it was not,negative
they didnt tell any of them fans make you who you are not the other way around,negative
to me history and truth mean a lot well its not some actors were great but that doesnt cover the plot now die already cheap special effects where is the fire its about what they need,negative
this is one of those this movie is not not well done,negative
hes the only reason to see this film he gives a very good performance much better than this crap deserves so if youre fans of either of them you might want to watch otherwise stay away,negative
wait a minute next so is this picture really that awful not exactly,negative
and that is probably all that it is good for like that im simply talking about the plot if you can call it that is it even evil at all so,negative
i always felt that a good film should have a plot not much really happens in this movie,negative
he was not as good as one would expect i guess the best part of the film was the end it had some cool action the only problem with the original was that it was too long this one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times now i know,negative
thats the entire plot i get it where are you in case you cant tell this is the worst movie ive ever seen,negative
he finds himself doing movies like this unfortunately there is nothing to recommend this film the police are boring the plot is stupid people run around its just no worth anything hes given nothing to do,negative
i dont understand why the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes unfortunately it is the only battle scene of the film unfortunately he is very bad in the film nothing makes sense,negative
the first reason this is interesting is the special effects,negative
now i like b movies it works as a b movie if youre one of those people then give this movie a shot,negative
a bunch of nothing happens for a long time for the viewer,negative
oh man they sure knew how to make them back then also the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as i expected them to be,negative
i dont mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it maybe it is just me probably not,negative
the awful story and the special effects are very but really very bad,negative
in this case however i have to say it was bad this movie was bad,negative
horrible do not watch this movie its time wasted out of your life that you can never get back,negative
next time show dont tell the audience i dont think it is,negative
this movie does not take itself seriously but what if it did,negative
apart from this there is nothing to save from this movie to make it short because it does not worth more even the fans of the genre can avoid it,negative
and i expected a lot from this film at the end i was disappointed but here that was a very bad idea,negative
not like it would matter with this movie what a joke what a show dont pay to rent it but do watch it for laughs,negative
absolutely one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time horrible dont waste your time,negative
if there is i dont want to know about it well there is one thats about the only thing that was less than awful in this movie,negative
when id seen the name of this movie id always thought it was a musical its not why is she so dead set against him well why else the other sister tries to take him away etc etc,negative
most movies i can sit through easily even if i do not particularly like the movie this is the first movie i could not stand to watch do not waste your time see a good movie,negative
im not surprised at all that this went straight to video,negative
theres no way i would have wasted my time on it but it was original and it was hilarious dont do it for the love of god,negative
a its not funny no one goes to see a movie how lame he isnt american and he doesnt go to movies lets rent it the movie isnt funny as i said before it gets really old really fast i give up,negative
a seriously usually when i see a movie thats not so good i ask myself could you have done any better,negative
its a film you can laugh at from the acting to the terrible zombie action going down the list the bad points of this film were as following,negative
i hate that i wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie its a shame that they got to call it a sequel because i was a fan of the original which was actually pretty good,negative
as for this picture it fails because of the subject matter,negative
the only thing we know about her is her name,negative
the story is ridiculous doesnt anyone think thats a little out of character not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living as it turns out none of that here,negative
annoying as all hell not saying they were horrible but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining then we got the actual movies memorable it makes you fall in love with the story and care about the characters masterpiece of crap enough said all and all i dont know why people like this,negative
just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong he tries way to hard the rest of the movie is just as bad,negative
creepy but by the time it comes you wont care in the least it is boring it is not to be watched,negative
well thats only half the truth who knows one other thing they needed all the help they could get history has shown us that,negative
there is a reason for where the sex scene is at,negative
t when the good dr which made much better use of a high budget turned in the character that dr,negative
this game was terrible no apparently really i think not and this game just isnt it,negative
this is one of those films oh and the plot,negative
cant we do our own version and boy did they add sex theyre better than that,negative
the director didnt do his job another director would have done a better job,negative
please do not waste your time on this move just watch the original again,negative
i wont waste your time telling you the plot read the other comments for that,negative
this is not the case here it does nothing right and it doesnt have the chance to because it doesnt really attempt to do anything a truly awful film,negative
this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life i dont think this movie could get any worse then it already is,negative
there is absolutely no plot in this movie no character development nothing but has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good so there you go do not expect nothing more that just that decent acting and a not so bad direction,negative
well it wasnt a complete waste in any case if you have nothing else better to do you can watch this movie,negative
this movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie,negative
the problems are many whats happened to the old man it makes no sense and finally what is with the musical score part of its character but it tries too many new things to take in with one film,negative
if theres anything worse than this movie i dont want to see it,negative
the editing was also pretty bad and the worst crime of all this mess is four hours long,negative
there is so much bad to say about this movie and so little thats good i didnt think movies could get this bad,negative
so i thought id try the film by the same name as for the story its just stupid what happened between the last scene and this one wrong why it is a very bad film,negative
so i fast forward all the way through the end dont waste your time watching this boring and bad movie,negative
then again what do i know im only a child,negative
will i now give it away to anyone who wants it probably its that feeling right here,negative
there are a couple of problems here but youll never guess what happens next,negative
there is really but one thing to say about this sorry movie it should never have been made but this one,negative
as far as romantic movies go this one is the worst ive seen,negative
all of these were a great hit but this clearly did not work out in this movie,negative
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life,negative
but hes out there and all he wants is blood why why why,negative
get it a t i seriously hate this movie the list just goes on dont this is not one of them,negative
i cant believe how bad it was other then that my friend this is one bad movie poor actors didnt know what they were getting into,negative
even then dont waste your time seeing this piece of something,negative
everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie i didnt take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all its just a sad stupid mess,negative
but unfortunately they both get it but what do the others do oh well,negative
but doing all this work first of all the acting and the lines are awful for most and most characters are just reading their lines,negative
i had watched it once long ago and didnt remember any of it now i know why the action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun b movie way,negative
today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldnt make it through from beginning to end,negative
not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot during the whole film i was like what is this movie all about after the movie many people said thats it,negative
they knew stuff could go wrong in fact stuff had gone wrong we see where this is going hilarious stuff what does this have to do with the point of the movie again,negative
the main character is so annoying that i couldnt care less what he does,negative
i would highly recommend seeing this movie forget my money i want my time back,negative
something along those lines one that i didnt care for maybe i just didnt get it ill leave it at that,negative
this movie may be the worst movie i have ever seen,negative
we watched it when it used to be on tv i didnt realize that there was a season four actually there wasnt why did they have to mess with a good thing,negative
i feel sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see this i am pretty sure i did not laugh once during this whole movie i just cannot believe they would make such a terrible movie this is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life,negative
but that doesnt mean that they always are funny its absolutely not funny,negative
however despite this the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script if you have any sense of history try to avoid this movie,negative
read a book now that has to really tell you something,negative
the monster i would try to run from the music mr,negative
the boys are annoying its just more annoying then funny ever,negative
what more can i say but it looks like one more line will do it save your time let alone your money on this dog of a film,negative
not a bad cast in my opinion however they were totally wasted in this movie i really do believe this is one of those straight to dvd movies that everyone will forget about very quickly which is a shame as the movie could have been so much better,negative
lets run through the main points i keep trying to think of one that wasnt possibly the mother but thats it its the worst movie ive seen at the cinema for years if not ever,negative
but i would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series,negative
it goes on and on for entire one and a half hour,negative
dr but i hate those bad dream movies you always feel let down,negative
it was obvious he wasnt going to be the one either this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night they dont get much worse than this,negative
the story is very easy to follow or theres nothing to follow you can see in either way yet as i said earlier if one has nothing to do except watching a movie this wont look so bad,negative
whats going on they were here now theyre there i had a lot of fun watching it,negative
because thats what this movie is oh it gets better,negative
i have just seen this movie and have not read the book well this is nothing like that it is so bad that i had to write my first comment in imdb,negative
and where is the so called husband he is no where to be found i would not to be with them either,negative
it was so predictable oh and the songs are so bad and so long the cast of the movie is too big for its own good the list just goes on and on,negative
but of course i was wrong now i never expected to like the first movie but in the end i was nothing but disappointed and unfortunately not exactly surprised that i felt that way,negative
seriously i dont even remember where it takes place how sad is that this one is a shame,negative
but as an action movie it has a few fairly good action scenes,negative
this is an old dark house movie the novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and i think could have been played straight to better effect and still could be,negative
i dont usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time i feel i have to i love films throughout this film i was thinking where is this going even near the end where did they get these awful actors from was that supposed to be a joke just my god really no,negative
we got the message the director seemed to have an easy job in this,negative
well what can you say about such a film and for a comedy it still isnt funny enough i dont know why people make films like this,negative
of the men around her when dr but wait but wait once more,negative
well where do i begin my story the plot was crap and so was the script very poor editing,negative
but not quite what she tells lee shes involved now and shes coming with him and remember later that same night they have sex also apparently if youre a major character in the film you can go straight to the head of the line you get the idea,negative
then things started to get little better did this have anything to say why did they even make a movie like this there are many of those,negative
thats how this would turn out if kids see this movie,negative
the script should have made more sense as well as the directing i had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie,negative
i do not see what is the whole deal about this movie,negative
i couldnt turn it off where do i start the writing directing acting and everything was just terrible,negative
this movie was so very badly written they should have never made a movie of this he was the only funny and believable one of the lot,negative
yes i know this was also a play but a documentary should be a documentary,negative
this movie is not that good at all its pretty stupid pretty annoying and very poorly done although i didnt hate it as much as them i still found it to be a pretty bad film,negative
but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case the better who knows enough said,negative
this movie is just as bad as it gets actors special effects and so on,negative
read the other reviews to see why no way i would go out of my way to watch it,negative
well this was not a surprise there is some really stupid scenes in this i would not recommend it,negative
worst thats the whole movie dont see this movie dont see this movie the director should be shot,negative
only you cant really call it horror its all pretty ridiculous one small surprise came near the end no it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot what more can i say there you have it,negative
it was worse than i had expected and i didnt expect much,negative
anyway thats all ill say on that matter because the director did too,negative
the ending didnt seem to make a whole lot of sense to me no matter how i looked at it the story just wasnt as good as the cast,negative
this was the worst movie i have ever seen it was just horrible i just wasted a moment in my life by watching this movie,negative
the horror you need to watch it once just for the great laughs youll have youll understand later,negative
the first hour of the movie was boring as hell there is no suspense no action not even a plot the movie went no where overall the movie wasnt good at all and i dont recommend it,negative
a is it realistic better and it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it at the writers not the scene she doesnt die though she should have somehow,negative
dr good joke bad joke bad bad bad good joke,negative
so what does this dumb actor do a this movie makes no sense at all you talking to me,negative
this movie is so bad that it actually gets funny one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my entire life this is just so bad horrible there is nothing else to say about this movie,negative
what is it hes just not thats about it didnt see any of that coming,negative
now as to why this film is so bad where do i begin crazy,negative
after reading this excellent work i could not wait to see the movie version of it after viewing the movie i was totally disappointed,negative
this movie was pretty bad i really dont know if this movie can be called original the acting is extremely cheesy the special effects are horrible this movie was pretty bad,negative
just like in real life the actors stay away far away,negative
what a waste of time and money wrong the special effects arent i guess i just expected too much from these actors,negative
so it is one of the worst film i have ever seen just worst i hate that,negative
i guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story its not really bad if you like that sort of thing you know,negative
whats up with that dont waste your time with this,negative
well we got it home and could not believe what we saw the main character is all over the place this is for you,negative
i wonder why the film just didnt work out at all well its not too hard to figure out really those who have seen the films of mr why you can definitely see what theyre getting at even from the first two three minutes maybe less of the film,negative
but i watched it all the way to the end just to get let down again with an absolutely terrible ending ive never seen the first one and will never after watching this its terrible acting with a terrible plot,negative
the problem is the story is quite predictable from very easily on through the movie,negative
the title song for this movie the movie does have its funny moments,negative
b i do like several b movies because theyre hilarious,negative
the ending of this movie made absolutely no sense please do,negative
believe it or not this movie is worse than number three there isnt a lot of good to say about this movie like number three this movie has nothing to do with the first two it is the same in name only,negative
this thing is horrible and hes the romantic hero i dont know what it is its just awful and its a horrible waste of talent,negative
after seeing the film i couldnt tell you what role he plays in the film ok the story is even worse i still dont understand what the writer director meant to say why are they in our time the same time as the characters,negative
the worst movie ive ever seen in my life unless you have no hope left in life absolutely avoid this crap,negative
this is the worst piece of crap ive seen in a long time how does something like this get made horrible horrible horrible i mean its horrible scary scary how does this stuff get made,negative
i just watched it last night and it wasnt really bad it was just weird so dont see this movie,negative
typical story of an evil kid going after people anyway this is one movie that youll do best to avoid,negative
this film has got so much in it and now you are thinking ive got to see this,negative
i cannot believe that this is a film that i did not like but this flick is just well bad i could deal with the subject matter if the script and story were better it was just bad so he gets four stars just above the average rating which this has so far,negative
however the characters plot this movie seemed more new age crap than anything else really or something similar it was a okay this is one of those movies where you cant think if you want to enjoy it any thought as to whats the point of that okay that makes no sense none at all everything is dead,negative
it fails badly at both could there be two movies with the same name,negative
i dont know but this in a word isnt funny see now thats funny i said in a word but then said isnt funny if this is your type of humor id say you havent really had much of a life and please dont ever write another review when i started the movie,negative
i just cannot seem to find him in this film,negative
not a good movie i cant believe i went save your time and money a film where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put into it,negative
let me be clear i doubt very much the late mr,negative
whatever is this guy for real sometimes it is not about you some people always think about the me me me sometimes it is about other people,negative
the plot is really slow and its almost an hour before anything of note happens and i didnt care for it even then,negative
seriously he shows up at the end to save the day i cant even remember why but apart from that hes not really in it,negative
avoid it unless its really late and theres nothing else on,negative
this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing the worst,negative
at this point theres still nearly an hour to go can you guess what happens now its not very deep or difficult,negative
has this ever happened to you so i take it home and watch it sorry and he is also a dumb cop why didnt he think of this before the cast is good,negative
and there was a lot of that believe me see the movie cant even get that part right,negative
well it should but she wasnt oh well whatever oh well whatever whatever,negative
everything about this film is just wrong why second the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie read the book,negative
movie a t movie perhaps they thought it could make it as a series well never know but i know one thing,negative
the idea behind this movie was great the actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again the high point is the acting of the little girl,negative
s but really this film doesnt have much of a plot,negative
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,negative
for a movie like this you dont expect much of the acting and that is just the way it was,negative
so how could this even be good well its not,negative
the cast for the show isnt any better though it does seem to love some fans it should really be left to the kids,negative
i didnt get to know any of the characters no scary special effects no suspense,negative
you get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly and it does,negative
but this movie was horrible and there is no way around it i did not laugh once throughout this entire movie,negative
and it does appear that there was some money spent on it not so,negative
this movie shows us nothing original mr this makes the movie easy to forget too bad dont you think,negative
you know why because the first had a great story sorry i did not mention him earlier it was not she in fact has a better idea the end i liked it when i was very very little it is even worse one of the worst things is the animation and the music is not at all beautiful or moving several people who played characters from the first did the same ones in this and i am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this the characters are different now that is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life they should think of the character,negative
the war at home is without a doubt the worst tv show for family,negative
i wont be too hard on this show because i enjoyed the first season but then things got worse its strange what the hell why go with a guy like that in the first place never mind,negative
this entire movie made absolutely no sense i was completely put off by the film you didnt get the characters whats his deal why should we care it just made no sense and why show a movie about a team that lost we got nothing why didnt you follow that story what were we to get out of this one the actor who played him was great who were they trying to kid it was all just a mess,negative
i have watched this movie over and over since it first came out,negative
as a stand alone movie it is awful the worst part of this movie however is the soundtrack i knew that it would probably be bad before i went,negative
this film is a very funny film the violence is bad the acting is this film is possibly the worst b rate film ever a really bad one very well done,negative
dont get me wrong she can be good in the right role just not this one,negative
you can pretty much figure out the rest from here this is where the movie falls apart is anyone there,negative
i was wrong i cant believe there arent more bad reviews how many ways are there to say this is a waste of time otherwise its not,negative
this wasnt what i wanted to see this music is really great,negative
and most of the acting is though slow ok if this film had a point it might have been much more interesting oh well,negative
like well just a little but still not enough to save it move along keep moving,negative
its not hard to see why look at the first couple of scenes but of course these are just ideas isnt that what his character would do,negative
but what was the point some of the comments the boys make,negative
to have to actually own up to making such a horrible movie who knows,negative
the original show was so much better they should have left on a good note this movie killed the whole idea sorry,negative
i guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down,negative
just awful plus the entire story i dont know why someone would make a movie with this story again do not waste your time or money,negative
ill start by saying that i have only watched to episodes i dont hate it but i dont like either,negative
i guess everyone involved would just rather forget of course there wasnt a whole lot to work with in the script is it really that easy you can tell the people involved as little talent or experience as they had really tried,negative
how wrong i was for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear period,negative
although it does have a few cheap laughs overall it is wrong wrong wrong bad bad bad,negative
that was the main reason i went to see this film,negative
but no matter its real easy to imagine what happened dr dr,negative
it really is that bad and i dont want to see you get killed you have the right to be dead yes he actually says that the acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie that is of course until the final fight scene of the movie does this stop him no of course not god its terrible,negative
unfortunately the man whose money it really is happens to be very bad very predictable not interesting at all come up with something a bit different ok guys,negative
second the acting was terrible third it was like completely different from the book no one would want to watch this it was horrible horrible,negative
this is by far the worst ever horror movie no make that any movie i have ever watched,negative
there were a few funny parts but thats about it a lot and if you dont want to waste your time it isnt please,negative
i hope it was a lot and they want you to take it seriously,negative
but the sad fact is that thats all there is,negative
i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like the show was pretty bad first of all the show just wasnt funny how the hell is that funny ill give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid,negative
mr but thats not even the long and the short of it why this movie is no different,negative
so why didnt i particularly enjoy it but all this just wasnt enough to make this film look any different than a b movie its a shame it could have been so much better,negative
black and white film believable characters just awful more could have been done with the main characters,negative
i dont what that other review was talking about and its bad i cant even begin to tell you how bad it is,negative
this movie was the worst ive ever seen do not watch this movie,negative
this is one of the most predictable movies i have ever seen and this supposed to be funny boring boring boring,negative
i made a little list of things i enjoyed in the movie move on the plot lots of action i didnt have to pay for it,negative
i havent seen such a bad movie for years i cant tell about the acting since the script was so terrible what a surprise,negative
poor writing and really truly no sense of character development if you dont know that you just dont know writing,negative
i was very disappointed in this movie but overall id say give this one a miss,negative
apart from one or two decent moments theres not much here to recommend,negative
maybe even in two years sorry thats it how this could go on for over an hour of my time much less days in the movie is beyond me do not go see this flick or even rent it on dvd,negative
it was by far the worse i have ever seen wrong it was like a home movie i would never recommend anyone to watch this,negative
it is well done and pretty funny in a dark way,negative
no instead the acting was so awful the jokes were extremely cheesy and the plot was no where to be found hilarious perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didnt understand s dont buy this movie,negative
there are a number of moments that just dont add up here maybe these are things that the people involved with making this film will eventually get more experience with though,negative
how funny can that be its not but why cant family guy do that when they dont even get it,negative
im not sure what points were even trying to be made,negative
this film for an after school special isnt that bad and thats the problem nothing happens you feel as if youre still in class also there are too many characters and no character development there boring as dull as the day is long and its been a long long day watching this movie,negative
well its a lot worse than you could possibly imagine,negative
either way i dont care or perhaps this movie was just crap,negative
how women and gay men one out of ten stars,negative
however as a stand alone film i found this very boring all in all i do not recommend this film for a family sit down,negative
the acting for the most part if fine save your money,negative
time has not been kind to this school of acting or to this movie the camera on him at all times,negative
its something you look at if you have absolutely nothing else better to do,negative
see i really wanted to enjoy this movie amazing i know but true not really,negative
at least for me of course it would have had to have been the right american the music was so important in this film it could not really work without the music working,negative
we get to see who the good guys are boring one of the worst films ever made,negative
i am telling you now please do not watch this film it is a waste of money and a waste of time instead you could actually be having fun,negative
yes thats the only thing what happens in this movie,negative
but why would he say such a thing so why would he say something like it when it wasnt true but wait theres more does that make him gay everyone has them funny no i know it wasnt what you thought,negative
save your money and view it for free on tv if you think it needs to be seen,negative
well i loved it wait i cant remember if that last one was in the film i dont know what happened,negative
actually i feel like having my review be that one word why dont i learn what was i thinking or has he been this way all along the plot is really really boring and predictable every time i hear lines like are we having fun yet,negative
the performances and the screenplay are totally stupid the only good thing about this movie is that its short so this crap will not stay with us for so long,negative
i still dont know why i forced myself to sit through the whole thing this is by far the worst movie ever made this film was very low budget two maybe three or cheesy in a good way or its so bad its good a movie is either good or its bad theres no such thing as a good bad movie,negative
how can you tell that a horror movie is terrible where exactly does this take place seems to be a mystery if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie though,negative
in this case mr i know this isnt set in reality but seriously how stupid can this get but what did he expect why did mr king write this horrible story and why was it made into a movie,negative
the premise of guess what happened to me on the way to the has been done over and over to death,negative
boy was i disappointed the plot oh wait there is no plot the end and then i killed him over and over i think not this never happens in the movie this man is never in the movie high quality,negative
its well made but what were they thinking with that ending the acting is fine from a decent cast,negative
we sure will in fact it happens during every scene too,negative
this is one of the most boring films ive ever seen,negative
and when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow,negative
that said the movie isnt exactly terrible the movie looks and sounds like episodes from a tv series that didnt make it past its third episode but the material just isnt there this time around so just try and be a good one okay,negative
so why do i hate this movie so much well where do i begin first of all the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous bad example moving on a s a after him a this movie tries to come off as funny and it does not because of the humor but because its just so bad the acting dialogue plot characters and ending are all so cheesy its hilarious,negative
oh boy where do i go with this one this isnt entertainment this is hell hell its just why would you waste your life on this crap this movie not worth it no you know what just stay away,negative
kids will love it and thats about it now this isnt to say that its all bad its a shame because that was really one of the best things it had going for it then again this makes it easy for the kids to follow kids will enjoy it but thats about it,negative
the book of mark no less i know i was,negative
this movie is like the material s for the most part the film is quite ridiculous,negative
and it is only a very few times and from this point on it never ever lets up a lot of it just doesnt make sense so is there anything good in this release,negative
do not watch this movie or this is the worst movies i have ever seen do not watch this,negative
this really cant be said about this movie it also has an ending which leaves you thinking this is it thats all,negative
yes i get all that what i find hard to take is i cant remember one single light moment in the entire film maybe it was true to life i dont know,negative
absolutely the worst experience i have ever been through only watch this if you want to make ever other movie you will ever watch seem great without question this is the worst movie i have ever seen,negative
and shes rich come on people but ill give it a shot that its not supposed to sound real is fine i dont care,negative
memorable acting by mark with such great lines as dont try to run truly should have been game over for bill but somehow and went on to better movies at least that movie was crazy this is just boring,negative
this was one of the worst movies that i have ever watched all the story was about was having sex over and over again,negative
i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame,negative
boy was i wrong this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen,negative
and it all went to hell now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor,negative
this movie is beyond bad perhaps i found this so funny because at that point i was the most high perhaps you are right as i was watching this i couldnt help but wonder is this movie meant for children is this really my life is this real,negative
there wasnt really anything to make this movie scary or worth watching s it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality,negative
i cannot get over how awful this movie was i cannot think of one thing that i like about this movie nothing,negative
this is the worst piece of crap ive seen in a long time how does something like this get made horrible horrible horrible i mean its horrible scary scary how does this stuff get made,negative
this film is awful it is not scary either this film is more like dark water except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it i was extremely disappointed with this film etc,negative
there really wasnt much of a story in this film but there isnt much more than that but still is that it,negative
the reason why i say hes evil dont believe me see it for yourself i mean really,negative
there were a few decent fight scenes and some over the top characters,negative
even the story didnt have to be original lots of them say what well you get the idea oh please id never heard of him before but i think he should give up acting and go back to his day job but why what does he do guess what that means oh well at least shes hot which leads me to my next problem with the movie none of that here i kid you not,negative
i think thats not a bad idea for a film really bad at least they got one thing right,negative
i must begin by saying that this is one of the most annoying films i have seen in my entire life you get my point check this one out,negative
that gets annoying fast but not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie,negative
this has got to be one of the worst shows ive ever seen the american version came out some years after id seen this original when played for laughs the storyline works,negative
unfortunately that really is the only question because there is no doubt that it does,negative
they are not just in the film do you want those things done to you they are not okay because they are just in the film do you want those things done to you to others why the world is awful enough already,negative
i mean this film is simply awful the acting is simply terrible but the rest of the film is worse and thats about it nothing in this film works i cant not recommend it enough,negative
bad bad movie i dont mind a predictable movie if its done well but this one absolutely was not,negative
it was all very boring and somewhat predictable dont waste your time stay away from this one,negative
the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series so that should tell you something right there i do have a sense of humor i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre as for the overall quality of the movie i didnt think it was that original or funny,negative
this might quite possibly be the worst movie i have ever seen i knew it was a b movie before watching it it was actually the reason for watching it but id never thought it could be this bad and watch out for the ending of the movie it comes at you fast,negative
the movie made it even worse i was highly disappointed about almost everything in the movie all ive heard about the movie are bad things and the movie deserves those bad things to be said about it i am not a fan of that this way youll get all of the scenes that were left out of the movie and you wont be completely lost when you watch it,negative
awful awful awful you actually might have to rent it its so bad,negative
what was wrong with it most of it actually but that doesnt change the obvious problems with the script,negative
this however unfortunately wasnt the case the main plot is interesting and somewhat original and the rest of the characters the sets are also awful and cheap looking like they can fall over and break down every moment,negative
well it is serious too serious the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again well this has no violence,negative
i may have seen worse films than this but i if i have i dont remember,negative
why but nothing comes of it too much talent wasted on such a weak script and poor editing,negative
i love good bad movies and this ones not even enjoyable on a bad movie level,negative
t soon enough it all gets very silly and predictable mr,negative
well you know the rest this has to be the worst movie ive seen in a long long time,negative
the worst problem is the acting its just so weird,negative
i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene,negative
the main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch,negative
i think not an actress playing herself why doesnt she just stand there and go me me me look at me i want my money back,negative
well this just maybe the worst movie ever at least the worst movie i have ever seen really nothing to tell about but that its just horrible how they can make movies like that in their right mind just cant understand that this cant be a hollywood movie is it,negative
ill admit that this isnt a great film i didnt know that this was a murder mystery film and was taken a bit by surprise im still not sure overall a good film no,negative
after that i watched this film i have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch,negative
im into bad movies but this has nothing going for it,negative
there is man who seen to have a had day in life,negative
just awful this movie is a complete waste of time theres lots of much better b movies that you can watch it was better work than this movie,negative
two words really bad now why do i think that second do not watch this movie it is not even so bad it is funny,negative
im not quite sure how to even put it into words was this supposed to be a comedy i dont review movies,negative
when i watched it as a kid i just didnt care for it in fact the part i liked best about this one was the opening credits,negative
boy was i wrong the picture was bad the sound was horrible and the acting oh the acting it was the worst acting in the history of film do not watch this film,negative
this sort of thing has been done better by lots of others dont go out of your way to see it,negative
